        "In WARFARIN repeated exposure to humans, the coagulation defects by  decreasing in prothrombin causes bleeding in different organs and also many symptoms accompanying it are seen. As a bleeding part, many organs and tissues, such as mucous membrane of gingiva and nose, gastroenteric tract, liver, brain, spinal epidural, urinary system and subcutaneous are described (EHC 175 (1995), ACGIH (2001), PDs (2006), PIMs (1997)). It was classified to as Cattegory 1 (blood systems) based on these informations. Based on the statement that since the little decrease of vitamin K concentration caused osteoporosis in humans, long-term treatment of low dose with anticoagulants may have a negative impacts on bone metabolism (EHC 175(1995)), it was classified to Category 1 (bone). Also in an animal, although it cannot be compared with a guidance value because of unknown dose or dosed through hypodermic injection, there is a statement of the bone loss (EHC 175 (1995)) and bone weakening by the cancellous bones loss (HSDB (2005))  etc. Moreover, it was classified to as Category 1 (skin) based on the statement that the skin necrosis (\"WARFARIN induced skin necrosis\") is known as one of the side effects of WARFARIN in humans (EHC 175 (1995), PDs (2006)) . Based on the statement of possibility of affction to liver and kidney (HSFS(2005)), it was classified to as Category 2 (liver, kidney) ."

Moreover, there is a description that the acute effect which appears after a single injection or injection for several days results from the bleeding and increase of bleeding tendency caused by the prothrombin inhibition. While there are reports on many bleeding cases (EHC 175 (1995), PIMs (1997), HSDB (2005)), and a statement that the target is the blood system (PIMs (1997)). It was set as Category 1(blood systems) based on the above information."
