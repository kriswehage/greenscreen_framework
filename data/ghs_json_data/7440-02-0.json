These effects were observed at dosing levels within the guidance values for Category 1 in the chronic studies. Therefore, the substance was classified as Category 1 (respiratory organs).\n\nThe chronic toxicity of nickel compounds in humans is mentioned as follows: \"Chronic exposure to nickel and its compounds may produce respiratory irritation and degeneration in humans even at doses close to occupational exposure limits. Prolonged exposure to high concentrations is likely to result in the fibroid lung\"(ECETOC TR33 (1989))."
