(ACGIH (2001), DFGOT (1996), IUCLID (2000)) .Therefore, it was decided that the skin sensitization could not be classified due to the absence of sufficient data.
Respiratory sensitization:  Although there are case reports on humans, such as asthmatic inducement by an asthmatic's alcoholic suction, it is not considered that the origin is an allergic reaction" (DFGOT (1996)). However, since the knowledge about the inhalation sensitization in the other humans and data on inhalation sensitization tests of  animals are not found, it was decided that it could not be classified due to insufficiency of data.</rationale>

On the other hand, ACGIH has classified ethanol into A4 (the substance which cannot be classificationed into human carcinogenicity, ACGIH (1996)) mainly as a hazardous property factor in work environment. Here, the hazardousness of alcoholic beverages as luxury grocery items was not assessed and classified, but it thought that the toxicity of ethanol was assessed.
