    <rationale>The substance is negative in the dominant lethal test in rats (CICAD 3(1998)), but it is positive in the in vivo micronucleus test using mouse peripheral blood (NTP TOX-49 (2004)). Therefore, although there are negative data from multi-generation mutagenicity tests, and positive data from mutagenicity tests using somatic cells, but there is no data from in vivo genotoxicity data for germ cells.

    <rationale>Although there is the effect to reproduction parameter (change of estrous cycle) under the condition of the big weight decrease in oral administration of rat and mouse, and there is a report about the decrease of the weight of embryo and about the increase of fetal resorption under the condition of maternal toxicity (decrease weight gain and increase mortality) (CICAD 3(1998), NTP TOX49 (2004)), these have low importance. There is the effect on testes (atrophy, histological alteration) in rat oral test (ACGIH (2001), CICAD3(1998)), and there is the decrease of weight of testis and epididymis in the rat and mouse oral test(NTP TOX49 (2004)). However, there is the indication to relasionship with reduced weight gain (NTP TOX49 (2004)), and in the long term (78 weeks) test of rat and mouse it is not observed effects to reproductive organs (CICAD 3 (1998)). The reproductive tissue effects is not occured in all the inhalation tests (ACGIH (2001),CICAD 3 (1998)).
On the other hand, there is almost no data about the reproductive function and reproductive potential.
Therefore, it was considered that it cannot be classified because of  the shortage of data.
In addition, as reference, a high doses administration (300 to 700 mg/kg, mouse LD50=250 mg/kg) into the abdominal cavity of a pregnancy mouse causes ferotoxity and teratogenicity (ACGIH (2001), IARC 20 (1979)).

[special notes] "an increase in embryo resorption" under the conditions of maternal toxicity which mortality rates increases was not considered as important effect. Moreover, effect on the reproduction parameter (change of the estrous cycle) under conditions of a severe weight decrease was not considered as important effect. Because, in (NTP ,the former literature of these data), as the summary of the reproductive and developmental toxicity in the introduction of the latest oral test for 14 weeks (NTP TOX49 (2004)), these above datas are not cited but two kinds of data (No.13, 14) with no effect or the lower incident of teratogenicity  and a part of ferotoxity are cited. And as the conclusion, it said "Data is insufficient and a summary will not come out." 
Moreover, by the conclusion of ACGHI (2001), it is "not almost all data affects a reproductive systems alternatively." and it is  no data in which "use is possible"(IARC 71 (1999)). </rationale>
