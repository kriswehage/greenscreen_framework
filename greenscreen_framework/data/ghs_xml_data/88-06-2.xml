    <rationale>Although weakly positive results were documented in mouse spot tests in which mice received intraperitoneal administration (in vivo mutagenicity studies using somatic cells) (EHC 93 (1989), ATSDR (1999), IARC 71 (1999)), these results were not dose-dependent. In addition, since the studies were evaluated as "negative" by the GENE-TOX, these results do not provide reliable evidence of positive results. In addition, although DNA damage tests by oral administration using rats showed negative results, no other proper, in vivo mutagenicity tests have been conducted. Therefore, the substance was classified into "Classification not possible" due to lack of sufficient data to justify classification into Category 2. As relevant information, in vitro studies, Ames and V79 hprt tests yielded negative results, while MLA, micronucleus and chromosomal aberration tests yielded positive results (ATSDR (1999), IARC 71 (1999)).</rationale>

    <rationale>In 2-year oral route exposure studies using rats and mice, frequencies of developing lymphoma and leukemia increased significantly in male rats (NTP TR155 (1979)), and frequencies of developing hepatocellular carcinomas and adenoma increased significantly in male and female mice (NTP TR155 (1979)). From these results, it was concluded that the substance was carcinogenic under these study conditions. In addition, according to IARC, some evidence of carcinogenicity was detected in animal experiments and the substance was classified into Group 2B based on the results obtained from exposure to polychlorinated phenol complex or its sodium salts (IARC 71 (1999)). In addition, EPA has classified the substance into Group B2 (IRIS (2002)). Based on these evaluations by IARC and EPA, the substance was classified into Category 2. In epidemiological research on soft tissue sarcoma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in humans (IARC 71 (1999)), causal relationships between exposure to this substance and tumorigenesis were unclear.</rationale>

    <rationale>Male rats that had been exposed to the substance via oral route for 11 weeks were mated with non-exposed females, and the females that became pregnant were examined 18 days after the mating; there were no adverse effects observed on sexual functions in parental animals, fertility, or development of fetuses (EHC 93 (1989)). However, this study was not conducted in compliance with the standardized protocol of reproductive studies, and provides insufficient data on teratogenicity including effects on development of fetuses. As such, classification is not possible.</rationale>

    <rationale>In the 90-day oral administration studies using rats, NOAEL was 80mg/kg/day and LOAEL was 240mg/kg/day based on increased weight and change in clinical test values of the liver that was examined as a target organ (Bercz JP, et al. 1990. Subchronic toxicity studies of 2,4,6-trichlorophenol in Sprague-Dawley rats. Journal of the American College of Toxicology 9(5): 497-506). Observed weight changes of the liver and adrenal gland at the administration dose of 240mg were not considered to be pathological changes. Since changes in ALT occurred at 720mg, the dose of 240mg is not considered to have any effects. Furthermore, other studies, including 2-year carcinogenicity tests by oral administration (mixed diet) using rats or mice, and 7-week oral administration tests which were conducted to determine doses to use in the former test mentioned above, were reported. In these studies, no general toxicity was detected other than moderate to marked increase in splenic hematopoiesis and midzonal vacuolation of hepatocytes in rats after administration of 4600 ppm (2300mg/kg/day) for 7 weeks, and leukocytosis and monocytosis in a 2-year test (NTP TR-155 (1979)). Also, no other studies (IARC vol. 71 (1999)) have reported clear effects of the administration other than changes in weights of organs. Overall, although these results indicate "Not classified" (oral), no severe toxic effects were observed at the guidance doses, and data on other routes of exposure are lacking. Thus, the substance was classified into the "Classification not possible" category.</rationale>
