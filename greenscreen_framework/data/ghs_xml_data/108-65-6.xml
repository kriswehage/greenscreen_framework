In addition, in oral administration tests using pregnant rats during the organogenetic period, no effects were observed on development of the offspring including teratogenicity (SIDS (accessed in June 2008)). As results suggested no adverse effects on reproductive functions, fertility, and development of the offspring including teratogenicity, the substance was classified into "Not classified".</rationale>

Furthermore, in 2-week inhalation exposure tests, degeneration of olfactory epithelium in nasal cavities were observed in mice at 1.62mg/L (90-day correction: 0.25mg/L) or above as an acute change, and the degeneration worsened and expanded with increased exposure concentrations. In some of the treated animals, inflammatory exudate was observed in their lumens (SIDS (accessed in June 2008)).

    <rationale>In combined repeated oral dose toxicity study with the reproduction/developmental toxicity tests using rats, decreased body weight gain and reduced food consumption were observed at 1000mg/kg/day, however, at 300mg/kg/day or below, no effects of exposure were observed. Its NOAEL was 300mg/kg/day (90-day conversion: approx. 150mg/kg/day) for both sexes and serious toxic effects were not detected (Toxicity Testing Reports of Environmental Chemicals (Chemicals Investigation Promoting Council) (accessed in June 2008)). On the other hand, in 2-week inhalation exposure tests, a slight increase in the eosinophilic granularity of the proximal convoluted tubules of the kidneys were detected mostly in male rats at 5.39mg/L (90-day conversion: 0.83mg/L) or above. In addition, degeneration of olfactory epithelium in nasal cavities in rats was detected at 16.18mg/L, and in mice, degradation occurred rapidly at concentrations of 1.62mg/L (90-day conversion: 0.25mg/L) or above, and it became more severe and extensive with increased exposure concentrations. In some of the treated animals, inflammatory exudate was observed in their lumens (SIDS (accessed in June 2008)), but its toxicological significance is unclear since the symptoms may be recoverable (the substance is a respiratory tract irritant by single exposure). From these results, symptoms observed in male rat kidney are mild, and histological changes in nasal cavities of rats and mice, especially of mice, were detected at concentrations within the range of Category 2 guidance values. However, since details of these tests were not provided, the substance was classified into "Classification not possible".</rationale>
