In other in vivo tests, negative results were reported in unscheduled DNA synthesis tests using rat hepatocytes (JMPR (2002)) while positive results were documented in comet assays using mouse leukocytes (HSDB (2007)). With respect to in vitro tests, Ames tests gave both negative and positive results, while mouse lymphoma assays yielded positive results.</rationale>

In 28-month, repeated oral administration tests using rats, incidences of pheochlromocytoma increased in a dose-independent fashion; however, by comparing with historical control data on frequencies of tumorigenesis, the EPA (1985) concluded that the substance is not indicated to be carcinogenic to rats (IRIS (1993)). Since the EPA has rated the substance as C in their classification based on these results, it was classified into "Not classified".</rationale>

    <rationale>According to 3-generation tests using rats, a decrease in mating ratio, the average number of offspring by 20-25%, and survival rates of offspring were documented (JMPR (2002)). Similarly, in other 3-generation tests using rats, a decrease in mating ratio, the average number of offspring, and survival rates of offspring until weaning were reported (JMPR (2002)). Furthermore, in the tests in which only male animals before mating were administered, a decrease in fertility and weight of the testes were documented (JMPR (2002)). Since these results are indicative of reproductive toxicity, the substance was classified into Category 2. No signs of teratogenicity were reported in these tests. Likewise, teratogenicity was not documented in administration tests using rats that were treated during the gestational period (JMPR (1976)), or two administration tests using rabbits that were treated during the gestational period (JMPR (1976), JMPR (2002)). </rationale>

In addition, at doses of 100 and 500 mg/kg, symptoms such as tremors, ataxia, decreased rotarod performance and body temperature as well as inhibition of cholinesterase activity were observed (JMPR (2002)). These results affirm that the substance is associated with nervous toxicity by inhibiting cholinesterase activity. In oral acute toxicity tests using rats or mice, signs of cholinergic syndrome were observed, while no pathological findings were detected by an autopsy (JMPR (2005)).

    <rationale>In repeated oral administration tests using rats that were treated with up to 89.7 mg/kg/d (90-day conversion: 49 mg/kg/d) for 49 days, neither clinical effects nor neurobehavioral effects were detected at any doses, but brain acetylcholinesterase activity was reduced by 80% (JMPR (2005)). On the other hand, in inhalation exposure tests using rats that were treated with up to 96 mg/m3 (90-day conversion: 0.022 mg/L) for 4 weeks, the inhibition of brain cholinesterase activity recovered to 83-84% of control values in 14 weeks; no other effects on haematological parameters, gross appearance post mortem or organ weights were found, while tremors were seen in both sexes (JMPR (2002)). In addition to these studies, repeated oral administration in rats that were applied with up to 58 mg/kg/d for 13 weeks resulted in showing no clinical signs related to the administration, and no effects of administration were detected in functional examinations (JMPR (2002)). While only few cases of nervous toxicity symptoms have been documented overall, since strong inhibitory effects on cholinesterase activity have been demonstrated, the substance was classified into Category 2.</rationale>
