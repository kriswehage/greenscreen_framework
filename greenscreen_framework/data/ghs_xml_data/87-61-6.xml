    <rationale>In the MOE Risk Assessment, vol. 4 (2005), it was reported that in a gavage oral administration study in 6-15 day pregnant rats, "a significant increase in liver weight and decreases in hemoglobin concentration and hematocrit value were observed in mother animals, but the number of fetuses, fetal weight and malformations in the skeleton and organs were not observed." HSDB (2004) also reported about the same study that "the abnormalities in the pregnancy results do not appear to be related to the exposure." Incidentally, in a gavage oral administration study in 6-15 day pregnant rats, it was reported that "liver and thyroid pathologies and decreases in hematocrit value and hemoglobin concentration were observed in mother animals. Slight osteogenic changes in fetuses were observed, but there were no severe malformations" (Patty (5th, 2001), DFGOT vol. 3 (1992)), and that "a teratogenic study showed no embryotoxicity and fetotoxicity" in DFGOT vol. 3 (1992). It is also reported in a 13-week feeding study in rats that "no effects on the weight of reproductive organs or on the tissues were observed in males and females" (MOE Risk Assessment, vol. 4 (2005)). However, since there is no data concerning effects on the reproductive functions and the data is insufficient classification is not possible. </rationale>

Moreover, the paragraph of human influence of the 4th volume (2005) of MOE Risk Assessment has a description that "an airway is stimulated, cough and pain in the throat were seen as acute symptoms, and stomachache, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting were developed by oral ingestion."

    <rationale>It has been described that, in the 13-weeks mixed feed administration test employing rats, " the weight increase of liver and kidney in female, increase of hepatic cell capacity and anisokaryosis increase in male and female, follicle reduction in thyroid gland, increase of the height of a follicular cell, colloid density reduction."(MOE Risk Assessment, Volume 4 (2005)), CaPSAR (1993), Patty (5th, 2001), DFGOT vol.3 (1992)). Since these symptoms were seen within the range of the guidance value of Category 2, it was classified into Category 2 (liver, thyroid). In addition, for humans, although there are descriptions of "The woman who had immersed the work clothes in Chlorobenzenes and washed them for a long period of time had experienced the aplastic anemias."(MOE Risk Assessment, Volume 4 (2005)), Patty (5th, 2001) and of "Some worker of 28 workers who was exposed to Trichlorobenzenes complained headache, giddiness, deep sleep, and indigestion" (MOE Risk Assessment, Volume 4 (2005))), the isomer has not been identified and it is unknown whether it is the influence due to this substance, it is not adopted. </rationale>
