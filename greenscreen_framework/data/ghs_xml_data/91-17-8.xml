However, the development of these neoplasms was likely related to alpha2u-globulin nephropathy specific to male rats, which may not be applicable as an indication of human carcinogenicity. In addition to these findings, marginally increased incidences of hepatocellular and uterine neoplasms were observed in female mice. Classification was not possible based on the absence of sufficient information for judging the carcinogenicity.</rationale>

    <rationale>Based on reports that the vapour can irritate the respiratory system (BUA Report 269 (2006)) and that breathing the substance can irritate the nose and throat (HSFS (2002)), the substance was classified into Category 3 (respiratory tract irritation). As relevant information, there is a report that vapour exposures in guinea pigs or dropping on rabbit eyes caused cataracts (PATTY (5th, 2001), HSDB (2004)).

    <rationale>In mouse inhalation tests, incidences of centrilobular cytomegaly of the liver were increased in males exposed to 0.14 - 2.26 mg/L (vapour, 6h/day) for 14 weeks (NTP TR513 (2005)), and incidences of hepatocyte vacuolization of the liver were increased in females exposed to 0.028 - 0.283 mg/L for 90 days or 0.287 - 1.435 mg/L (24h/day) for 30 days (NTP TR513 (2005), BUA Report 218 (1998)). Since these effects were observed at dose levels within the guidance value range for Category 1, the substance was classified into Category 1 (liver). In rat and mouse inhalation tests, the exposure to 0.287 - 1.435 mg/L (6h/day) for 30 day caused concentration-dependent histopathological changes in the trachea, bronchi and alveoli (formation of hyaline droplet on the tracheal epithelium, loss or proliferation of cells, exudate, increased incidence of type II alveolar epithelial cells in tracheobronchial epithelium). Additionally, in a guinea pig inhalation test, exposure at the same concentration for the same period caused irritation to alveoli with multifocal pneumonia, alveolar wall thickening with exudate (NTP TR513 (2005), BUA Report 218 (1998)). Since these effects were observed at dose levels within the guidance value range for Category 1, the substance was classified into Category 1 (respiratory system). Based on effects in both liver and respiratory system, the substance was classified into Category 1 (liver, respiratory system). As relevant information, in rat tests, degeneration in renal tubules with alpha2u-globulin accumulation and hyaline droplet accumulation was observed in the kidney of male rats (NTP TR513 (2005)), however, the lesion was the alpha2u-globulin nephropathy specific to male rats which may not be considered as a human risk. Therefore, this result was not used as the basis of classification. Additionally, it was reported that excessive exposure to high concentrations caused numbness, nausea, headache, and vomiting in human (PATTY (5th, 2001).</rationale>
