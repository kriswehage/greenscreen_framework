There is a description as follows, however, about this study, "Since the effect on eyes was not dose dependent, there seems to be no relation between this substance and exposure."(EU-RAR (2003)) In addition, there is a description as follows in the forced oral administration study applied to rats for 6-15 days during pregnancy, "Lesions in the liver and thyroid gland and decrease in hematocrit values and hemoglobin concentrations were observed. Although slight osteogenic changes were observed in fetuses, no serious deformation was observed" (Patty (5th, 2001), DFGOT vol. 3 (1992)).

There are descriptions of "The increase in the relative weight of liver was seen" in 4 weeks inhalation exposure test employing rats.

Since all these symptoms were seen within the range of the guidance value of Category 2, it was classified into Category 2 (liver, kidney, thyroid gland, nasal cavity). In addition, for humans, although there are descriptions of "The woman who had immersed the work clothes in Chlorobenzenes and washed them for a long period of time had experienced the aplastic anemias."(MOE Risk Assessment, Volume 4 (2005)), Patty (5th, 2001) and of "Some worker of 28 workers who was exposed to Trichlorobenzenes complained headache, giddiness, deep sleep, and indigestion" (MOE Risk Assessment, Volume 4 (2005))), the isomer has not been identified and it is unknown whether it is the influence due to this substance, it is not adopted. </rationale>
