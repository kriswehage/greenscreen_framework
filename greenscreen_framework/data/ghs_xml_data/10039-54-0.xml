In addition, application of 50 mg for 24 hours triggered severe irritation (slight erythema, severe edema and corneal opacity continued for 8 days) (IUCLID (2000)).

Based on these negative results, the substance was classified into "Not classified". Also, Ames tests yielded negative results (NTP DB (accessed in December 2008) (IUCLID (2000)) while mouse lymphoma assays gave positive results (IUCLID (2000)).</rationale>

    <rationale>In the tests using female C3H/HeN mice (provirus carriers) that underwent oral administration for 123-weeks through drinking water, there was no significant difference between treated and control groups in terms of development of hepatocellular carcinomas, lung adenomas, lymphomas and tumors of the ovary; however, increased vascular neoplasms of the spleen were observed in treated animals (IUCLID (2000)). In the tests using both sexes of C3H/HeJ (+) mice (virus carriers) that underwent oral administration for 105 weeks through drinking water, increased vascular neoplasms of the lymph node (hemangiomas) and lymphomas in males were observed (IUCLID (2000)). In life-long, mixed diet tests using both sexes of AKR (m), C3H (f) or Swiss (m) mice, a decrease in development of tumors was observed in C3H strain, while an increase in tumorigenesis was not detected (IUCLID (2000)). Since the increased tumorigenesis is discovered using datasets that involved provirus carrying mice, and there are no datasets using other animal species, the substance was classified into "Classification not possible".</rationale>

In other oral administration tests using rats, cyanosis was detected at 250 mg/kg, which falls under Category 1 guidance doses, and cyanosis, lachrymation and convulsions were observed at 2500 mg/kg, which falls under Category 2 guidance doses. In addition, in dermal administration tests using rabbits, cyanosis and splenomegaly were seen at &gt;= 100 mg/kg, which falls under Category 1 guidance doses. And in other dermal administration tests using rabbits, cyanosis, hypothermia, reduction in red blood cell counts, increases in reticulocyte counts and splenomegaly were found at 500 mg/kg, which falls under Category 1 guidance doses (IUCLID (2000)).

In 3-month oral administration tests through drinking water (doses: 10, 50 or 250 mg/L (conversion values: ca. 0.9, 4 or 21 mg/kg, respectively)), hemolytic anemia and splenomegaly were detected at 4 and 21 mg/kg, which fall under Category 1 guidance doses (IUCLID (2000)). Finally, in 3-week dermal administration tests using rabbits that were treated with 0.73, 1.47, 5.85 or 11.7 mg/kg, anemia was observed at 1.47 mg/kg (90-day conversion: 0.37 mg/kg), which falls under Category 1 guidance doses (IUCLID (2000)).
