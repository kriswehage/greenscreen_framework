In addition, mild irritation was observed in humans to whom the test substance was applied for 3 days or more (HSDB (2005)). It is also reported that the use of medicine containing aluminum chloride for the treatment of hyperhidrosis worsened miliaria (HSDB (2005)).

    <rationale>The substance was classified into "Not classified" based on the following information: Buehler tests using guinea pigs found that the substance is not sensitizing (IUCLID (2000)); maximization tests using guinea pigs found that the substance is not sensitizing (IUCLID (2000)); maximization tests on humans found that the substance is not sensitizing (IUCLID (2000)); patch tests on humans found that the substance is not sensitizing (IUCLID (2000)). On the other hand, positive reactions were found in patch tests applied to patients whose itchy dermatitis worsened by using antiperspirant containing aluminum chloride (EHC No. 194 (1997)), and in patch tests applied to children who received a shot of aluminum-bound vaccine during infancy to prevent hypersensitivity (EHC No. 194 (1997)); however, the link between the positive reaction and aluminum chloride is not clear.</rationale>

    <rationale>It is documented that no effects of the substance were detected in either 3-generation tests using rats that underwent oral administration through drinking water (19.3 mg/kg/day) (JECFA (series 24: 2007)), or developmental toxicity tests using rats that were fed with a mixed diet (91 mg/kg/day) between day 6 and 19 of the gestational period (IUCLID (2000)). However, in forced oral administration tests using mice that were applied with 41 mg Al/kg/day (202 mg AlCl3/kg/day) between day 7 and 16 of the gestational period, an increased embryo resorption was observed, while toxic effects on the parents were unclear (ATSDR (2008)). In addition, in mixed diet tests using rats that were fed with 272 mg Al/kg/day (1343 mg AlCl3/kg/day) between day 1 and 20 of the gestational period, significant impairment in the righting reflex and grasping reflex were observed in rat pups, while toxic effects on the parents were unclear (ATSDR (2008)). Moreover, in forced administration tests using rats that were applied with 900 or 1800 mg/kg on day 15 of the gestational period, significant effects were detected on timing of pinna detachment and eye opening, and learning acquisition in offspring, while toxic effects on the parents were unclear. Since exposure to the test substance during prenatal period is documented to affect development and behavior of the offspring (IUCLID (2000)), the substance was classified into Category 2.</rationale>

    <rationale>In 60-day forced oral administration tests using rats, an increased acetylcholinestrase activity was observed in olfactory bulb, striatum and hypothalamus at the dose of 320 mg Al/kg bw (90-day conversion value: 213 mg/kg/day), which falls under the guidance values for the "Not classified" category (CaPSAR (2000)), indicating the effects of the substance on the nervous system. In 180-day tests using rats that underwent administration in drinking water, reduced spontaneous locomotor activity, impaired acquisition, extinction and reacquisition of an active avoidance task were observed at the dose of 12 mg Al/day per rat (59 mg AlCl3/day per rat), which falls under the guidance values for Category 2 (CaPSAR (2000). Furthermore, in 3-month tests using rats that underwent administration in drinking water, impairment of post-rotatory nystagmus was observed at the dose of 43.1 mg/kg/day, which falls under the Category 2 guidance values (ATSDR (2008)). Based on these results, the substance was classified into Category 2 (nervous system). Also, in 21-day forced oral administration tests using rats, a significant decrease in red blood cells, hematocrit, and serum iron concentration; an increase in platelets; and a decrease in hemoglobin were found, suggesting that exposure to aluminum may cause normocytic anemia (IUCLID (2000)). However, the exposure dose was 494 mg/kg/day (90-day conversion value: 115 mg/kg/day), which fell under the guidance values for the "Not classified" category.</rationale>
