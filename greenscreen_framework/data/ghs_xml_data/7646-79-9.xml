Since in vivo genetic toxicity tests using germ cells are not available, the substance was classified into Category 2.

    <rationale>In the tests using mice that underwent administration in drinking water for 12 weeks (200, 400, or 800 mg/L), lowered fertility and a decrease in implantation sites and survival rate of the offspring were observed (CICAD 69 (2006)). In addition, in the tests using mice that underwent administration in drinking water for 10 weeks (400 ppm), an increase in loss of pre-implantation embryos, and a decrease in gestation rates, number of pups per litter, and fertility were observed. These documents report clear cases of reproductive toxicity, while no descriptions on general toxicity are provided; thus, the substance was classified into Category 2. Also, the substance is rated as Cat. 3 (R60) in the EU classification (which is equivalent to Category 1B) (EU-Annex 1 (accessed in January 2009)).</rationale>

In addition, there is a description that the ingestion of the substance by children may cause cyanosis due to the inhibition of erythrocyte synthesis, coma, or death (HSDB (2004)). The effects of this substance documented include retrosternal chest pain, tinnitus, nausea and vomiting, nerve deafness, thyroid hyperplasia with tracheal oppression, myxedema, and malaise (HSDB (2004)). In forced oral administration tests using rats, decreased spontaneous activity was observed at 4.25 mg/kg (ATSDR (2004)).

    <rationale>Oral administration of 150 mg/day to 6 males of ages 20 to 47 resulted in an increase in erythrocytes by 16 to 20% (CICAD 69 (2000)). An accidental intake of the substance (2.5 g) by 6-year old child resulted in vomiting and neutropenia (HSDB (2004)). In inhalation tests using rabbits treated with 0.4-2 mg/m3 for 14-weeks, a peculiar nodule increase of type II pneumocytes was detected (Japan Society for Occupational Health (2008)). In 3-week oral administration tests using rats treated with 50 mg/kg bw/ cobalt chloride (90-day correction: 12 mg/kg), myocytolysis was observed (CICAD 69 (2006)). In forced oral administration tests using rats treated with 0.05 or 2.5 mg/kg/day for 7-months, delayed latency reflex was observed in animal groups treated with 2.5 mg/kg/day (90-day correction: 5.8 mg/kg/day) (ATSDR (2006)). In 4-week mixed diet tests using rats treated with 3.79 mg/kg/day (90-day conversion: 1.17 mg/kg/day), atrophy of the thyroid gland was detected (ATSDR (2004)). In 45-day administration tests through drinking water using mice treated with 26 mg/kg/day, necrosis and inflammation of the thyroid gland were observed (ATSDR (2004)). Finally, in 12-week administration tests through drinking water using mice treated with 200-800 mg/L, testicular weight markedly decreased, and in four other tests, decreased testicular weight and testicular degeneration or atrophy were detected (IARC (vol. 86, 2006), ATSDR (2004)). Based on these results, the substance was classified into Category 1 for lung, nervous system and thyroid gland, and Category 2 for blood, cardiac muscle and genitalia. With regard to animal tests, documents that addressed serious cases were adopted as rationale for the classification.</rationale>
