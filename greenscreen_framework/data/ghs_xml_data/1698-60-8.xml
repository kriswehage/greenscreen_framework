The concentration of 0.25 mg/L is a concentration of pesticide formulations and is equivalent to 0.16 mg/L of this substance. Overall, based on these LC50 values of &gt; 0.15 mg/L (conversion value: 17 ppm) and &gt; 0.16 mg/L (conversion value: 18 ppm), the category for this substance cannot be determined; thus, it was classified into "Classification not possible".</rationale>

    <rationale>In 3-generation tests using rats that received 150 to 1350 ppm, symptoms of reproductive toxicity (mating, pregnancy rate, gestational period, and litter parameters) or teratogenicity were not detected (IUCLID (2000)). In teratogenicity tests using rats that received 0 to 250 mg/kg bw (OECD 414, GLP-compliant) and rabbits that received 55 to 495 mg/kg bw (OECD 414, GLP-compliant), no signs of teratogenicity, embryotoxicity, or fetal toxicity were observed at doses that showed toxic effects on maternal animals (IUCLID (2000)). In other tests, either reproductive toxicity or developmental toxicity was detected in mice that received 5000-10000 ppm (FDA guidelines) or rats that received 0 to 1600 ppm (HSDB (2007)).

In addition, in 3-month mixed diet tests using dogs that received doses of 100 to 10000 ppm (2.4-326.6 mg/kg), findings were limited in changes in organ weight and clinicochemical parameters observed at 326.6 mg/kg (IUCLID (2000)); however, these results indicate that the substance is to be categorized into "Not classified" (oral route).
