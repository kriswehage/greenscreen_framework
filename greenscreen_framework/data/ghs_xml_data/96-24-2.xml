(non-genotoxic mechanism) agreed in 2007, probable IARC 2B." in expert discussion between ICSC and IARC, the substance was classified into Category 2. In a rat 104-week drinking water test, the mortality rate was unaffected, but dose-related alterations in the incidence of hyperplasia and/or tumours were observed, with increases in the kidney, testis, mammary gland and preputial gland, and decreases in the pancreas. However, the authors concluded that the renal tumours were considered to be secondary to increase in the incidence of chronic progressive nephropathy and the testicular and mammary tumours were suggested to be secondary to the disturbed endocrine balance (JECFA (2001)).</rationale>

In a 2- or 4-week oral administration test with male rats, after recovery period, the high dose (8 mg/kg/day) group showed no effects on sperm motility but no pregnancies resulted from the mating with untreated females (JECFA (2001)). The same effects on sperm motility were observed in another rat 9-day oral test in which it was reported that sperm from males of the highest dose did not reach the oviducts of females, the percentage of fertilized eggs in the oviducts of mated females was decreased in a dose-dependent manner (JECFA (2001)). The substance was classified into Category 1B since inhibition of male fertility was observed in rats by oral administration.</rationale>

    <rationale>There are reports that renal insufficiency at 130 mg/kg and death from acute glomerulonephritis at 260 mg/kg occurred following oral administration to rats (DFGOT vol. 5 (1993)). It was also reported that microscopic findings such as necrosis and regeneration of the tubular epithelium accompanying precipitated protein in and dilation of the tubules were observed in another test in rats dosed by gavage at levels of 100 - 200 mg/kg (HSDB (2002)). The substance was classified into Category 1 (kidney) since these findings were observed at dose levels within the guidance value range for Category 1. Additionally, clinical observations such as sluggishness, flaccid paralysis of head and legs, and hypnosis were observed in a test in rats dosed by gavage at levels of 100 - 200 mg/kg, and ataxia, grotesque posture, loss of righting reflex, delirium and partial paralysis were observed in a mouse oral test dosed at levels of 100 - 220 mg/kg (HSDB (2002)). Although these findings correspond to Category 1 based on guidance value range, the substance was classified into Category 2 (central nervous system) because of information in List 2 and non-meeting Decision criteria 1b 3). On the other hand, based on reports of minimal irritation to the respiratory tract as clinical signs of toxicity in both rat and mouse inhalation tests (HSDB (2002)), the substance was classified into Category 3 (respiratory tract irritation).</rationale>

    <rationale>In rat oral tests, chronic progressive nephrosis was observed after dosing of 60 mg/kg/day for 4 weeks (90-day equivalence: 18.5 mg/kg/day), and after dosing of 1.1 - 35 mg/kg/day for 104 weeks (JECFA (2001)). Since this lesion was observed at dose levels within the guidance value range for Category 1, the substance was classified into Category 1 (kidney). There is a report that hematological abnormalities including anemia, leukopenia, and severe thrombocytopenia were induced by oral administration to 6 monkeys at 30 mg/kg bw/day for 6 weeks and 2/3 monkeys died from myelosuppression (JECFA (2001)). Additionally, in a rat 4-week oral test, significant decreases in hemoglobin concentration, hematocrit and erythrocyte count were reported at dose level of 60 mg/kg/day (90-day equivalence: 18.5 mg/kg/day) (JECFA (2001)). Since these findings was observed at dose levels within the guidance value range for Category 2, the substance was classified into Category 2 (blood system). Additionally, histopathological findings in the testis were also reported, but the effects are considered to be subsumed under reproductive toxicity items and are not classified in specific target organ toxicity.</rationale>
