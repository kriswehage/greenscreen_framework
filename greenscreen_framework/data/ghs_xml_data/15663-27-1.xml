    <rationale>Based on a positive result in a mouse spermatocyte chromosomal aberration test (in vivo test) (PATTY (5th, 2001)), the substance was classified into Category 1B. As relevant information, there are other in vivo test reports of a negative mouse dominant lethal test (IARC suppl. 7 (1987)), positive mouse and rat bone marrow chromosomal aberration tests (EHC No. 125 (1991), PATTY (5th, 2001)), a positive mouse bone marrow sister chromatid exchange test (EHC No. 125 (1991)), and a positive mouse somatic cell DNA adduct formation test (PATTY (5th, 2001)). From in vitro mutagenicity tests, there are reports of a positive Ames tests, a positive chromosomal aberration tests and a positive micronucleus tests (EHC No. 125 (1991), IARC vol. 26 (1981), NTP DB (access on Oct. 2009)).</rationale>

No epidemiological test of the substance as a single agent are available. Among animal examinations, intraperitoneal administrations to mice increased the incidence of lung adenomas and similar treatments increased the incidence of skin papillomas in mice given promoting treatment of croton oil applied to the skin. In two tests, multiple intraperitoneal injections to rats induced leukaemia (IARC suppl. 7 (1987)).</rationale>

    <rationale>There are human case reports that among 13 women treated with cytostatic drugs containing the substance during the first trimester of pregnancy, lower birth weight was noted in two of five mothers who continued the pregnancy until child birth and spontaneous abortions occurred in 4 women (PATTY (5th, 2001)). The substance was shown to cause azoospermia within 2 months after initiation of treatment (HSDB (2009)). In the substance's package insert, it is reported that "This drug should not be given to pregnant women and women suspected of being pregnant", "(in animal tests) teratogenic effects and increased fetal lethality in rats and increased fetal lethality in rabbits were observed and teratogenic and fetal lethal effects were reported in mice." "If mothers take this drug, they must be instructed not to breast feed (the substance was reported to pass into breast milk" (cisplatin drug RANDA Injection package insert (2009)).

    <rationale>The substance was used as an antineoplastic drug, so human toxicity data are available from adverse drug reaction reports for treated patients. There are no data for the oral, dermal and inhalation routes and it is difficult to determine whether a single dose or repeated doses were involved. The following symptoms are reported as the substance's acute toxicity: intractable nausea and vomiting as toxicity to the gut; leucopenia, thrombocytopenia as toxicity to the bone marrow (IARC vol. 26 (1981)), renal tubular function impairment as toxicity to the kidney, decreased hearing, "thick" speech, impairment of taste, numbness of hands, gait disturbances, loss of reduction of deep tendon reflexes, disorientation, paranoia, sensory function loss and motor function loss as toxicity to the nervous system (PIM 132 (1992)). The substance was classified into Category 1 (alimentary system, bone marrow, kidney, nervous system). As relevant information, mild and transient liver toxicity has occurred (PIM 132 (1992)). However, this information was not used as the basis of classification since there is a report that rarer risks include hepatic effects (PIM 132 (1992)).</rationale>

    <rationale>The substance was used as antineoplastic drug, so human toxicity data are available from adverse drug reaction reports for treated patients. There are no data for oral, dermal or inhalation routes of exposure. The following symptoms are reported as long term therapy effects; anemia, thrombocytopenia, leucopenia as toxicity to the bone marrow, remarkable decrease in glomerular filtration rate as toxicity to the kidney, peripheral neuropathy, optic neuritis, papilledema, vibration sensory and hyporeflexia of the ankle, epileptic seizure, marked nausea and vomiting, and gastrointestinal disorder as toxicity to the gut (PATTY (5th, 2001), PIM 132 (1992)). Based on all the data, the substance was classified into Category 1 (bone marrow, kidney, nervous system, alimentary system). In the substance's package insert, there are the following reports as significant adverse reactions; acute renal failure, myelosuppression such as pancytopenia, shock, anaphylactoid reaction, decreased hearing, hearing loss, tinnitus, papilledema, retrobulbar neuritis, cortical blindness, cerebral infarction, transient ischemic attack, hemolytic-uremic syndrome, myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmia, hemolytic anemia, interstitial pneumonitis, syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone, fulminant hepatitis, hepatic dysfunction, jaundice, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, peptic ulcer, gastrointestinal perforation, acute pancreatitis, hyperglycemia, exacerbation of diabetes, and rhabdomyolysis (cisplatin drug RANDA Injection package insert (2009)).
