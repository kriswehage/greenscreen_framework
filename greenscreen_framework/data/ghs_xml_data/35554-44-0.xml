Similarly, negative results were yielded in unscheduled DNA synthesis tests using mouse hepatocytes (in vivo genotoxicity tests using somatic cells) (JMPR No. 8 (2000): (JMPR No. 31 (1977)). Negative results were also acquired in in vitro mutagenicity tests such as Ames tests, chromosomal aberration tests, and mutation tests using cultured V79 cells from Chinese hamsters (JMPR No. 8 (2000), (HSDB (2006)).</rationale>

    <rationale>In 2-year oral administration tests using rats (JMPR No. 6 (2001)), hepatocellular adenoma and follicular-cell tumors of the thyroid were observed in the animal groups treated with the highest concentration tested; however, the purity of the test substance was 50%. In contrast, in other oral administration tests using rats that were conducted for 30 months (JMPR No. 8 (2000)), histopathological effects related to the administration on the liver were not observed, concluding that there is no evidence of carcinogenicity associated with this substance. Yet, in other 2-year oral administration tests using rats (JMPR No. 21 (1980)), the conclusion was drawn that this substance is not involved in tumorigenesis of the organs. Furthermore, in 23-month oral administration tests using mice (JMPR No. 8 (2000)), although increased incidences of adenoma were detected, the conclusion was drawn that there was no statistically significant trend for carcinomas. Similarly, no signs of carcinogenicity were detected in other tests including 18-month oral administration (through drinking water) tests using mice (JMPR No. 21 (1980)), and 2-year oral administration tests using mice (HSDB (2006)). Based on these results, the substance was classified into "Not classified".</rationale>

    <rationale>In several 2 or 3-generation tests using rats, no signs of teratogenicity were detected; on the other hand, decreased survival of fetuses and increased fetal death rates were identified (JMPR No. 31 (1977), IRIS (1990), JMPR No. 8 (2000)). In reproductive toxicity tests using rats that were in compliance with OECD guidelines, besides reduced body weight in maternal animals, no significant differences were noticed compared with control animals in terms of pregnancy rates, the number of corpora lutea and implantation rates. Furthermore, in above-mentioned tests, in which developmental toxicity tests were also conducted, no signs of teratogenicity were detected in fetuses, while the number of embryos and fetuses along with fetal body weight decreased (JMPR No. 12 (2005)). Overall, while no reports on general toxicity on parental animals are available, a decrease in survival rates of fetuses and increase in fetal death rates were detected; thus, the substance was classified into Category 2.</rationale>

Furthermore, in dermal administration tests using rats or rabbits (JMPR, No. 12 (2005)), no toxic effects were detected using doses that fall under the category guidance values. Though these results indicate that the substance is to be placed into the "Not classified" category (inhalation and dermal), in conclusion, it was classified into "Classification not possible" because information on its toxic effects via oral administration is not available.</rationale>

    <rationale>In 3-month oral administration tests using rats, an increased frequency of hepatocytes with small vacuoles was seen at 2400 and 3200 ppm (conversion value: 180 and 250 mg/kg for male; and 240 and 330 mg/kg for female, respectively) (JMPR No. 6 (2001)). In 14-week (3-month) oral administration tests using rats, hepathocellular necrosis was documented at the concentration of 800 ppm (90-day conversion value: 40 mg/kg) (HSDB (2006)). Furthermore, in 3-month oral administration tests using mice, an increased incidence of dark livers was identified at the highest doses (male: 140 mg/kg/day, and female: 170 mg/kg) and the middle doses for males (53 mg/kg/day); histological examination showed an increase in the numbers of small and large vacuoles, especially in the periportal area in both sexes (JMPR No. 8 (2000)). In summary, in oral exposure tests using rats or mice, the effects of exposure on the liver, such as necrosis of hepatocytes, were found in the range of doses that are comparable to Category 2 guidance values. Thus, we decided to place the substance in Category 2 (liver).</rationale>
