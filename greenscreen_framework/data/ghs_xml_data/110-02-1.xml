    <rationale>In a combined repeat dose and reproductive/developmental toxicity screening test with rats (OECD TG422), as general toxicity, clinical signs such as decreased locomotor activity, prone position and salivation were observed at 100 mg/kg and/or 400 mg/kg, but no adverse effects on sexual function and fertility of parental animals or development of offspring ("Toxicity Testing Reports of Environmental Chemicals" (Chemicals Investigation Promoting Council) (access on Aug. 2009)). However, poor maternal behavior and lactation were observed in the 100 mg/kg and more groups and the lower tendency of viability on postnatal day 4 in the 400 mg/kg group was attributed to the poor maternal behavior and lactation ("Toxicity Testing Reports of Environmental Chemicals" (Chemicals Investigation Promoting Council) (access on Aug. 2009)). Since these dams showed degeneration of cerebellar nuclei neurons, poor maternal behavior and lactation were considered to be a secondary consequence by thiophene-treated ("Toxicity Testing Reports of Environmental Chemicals" (Chemicals Investigation Promoting Council) (access on Aug. 2009)). In conclusion, classification was not possible since data for developmental toxicity including teratogenicity were insufficient.</rationale>

    <rationale>In a rat oral test (OECD TG423), no death was observed. At 300 mg/kg, ptosis, salivation and soiled perineal region were noted, body weight gain was generally normal, and no gross pathological lesion was seen at the end of the observation period. At 2000 mg/kg, decreased locomotor activity, ptosis, salivation, staining around mouth and nose, and abnormal fur were noted. Body weight decreased on day 4 and tended to recover on day 8 of observation, but no gross pathological lesion was seen at necropsy ("Toxicity Testing Reports of Environmental Chemicals" (Chemicals Investigation Promoting Council) (access on Aug. 2009)). Since no significant toxic effects were observed at 2000 mg/kg, the substance corresponds to "Not classified" with oral exposure. However, classification was not possible due to lack of data with other exposure routes.</rationale>

    <rationale>In a combined repeat dose and reproductive/developmental toxicity screening test with rats (OECD TG422) (for approximately 45 days), no death was observed in either sex but clinical signs such as irregular respiration, decreased locomotor activity, prone position and salivation were observed at 100 mg/kg in males and 400 mg/kg in females. On histopathological examination for males, hypertrophy of hepatocytes and infiltration of macrophages in the central zones were observed at 100 mg/kg and higher dosage levels. At 400 mg/kg, necrosis of hepatocytes and homogenous or vesicular cytoplasmic change of hepatocytes in the central zones were observed as well as increases in the concentrations of plasma total bilirubin and activities of various enzymes. Thus, hepatic toxicity was noted in the groups administered 100 mg/kg or higher doses. In addition, at 400 mg/kg slight toxicity to the cerebellum was indicated, since pyknosis/necrosis of granular cells in the cerebellum was observed for one male. In surviving females, hepatic changes similar to those observed in males of the 400 mg/kg group were found in the groups administered 100 mg/kg or higher doses. In addition, necrosis of cerebellar granular cells was observed in the groups given 100 mg/kg or more. In the 400 mg/kg group, dilatation and edema of the ventricles were evident. Thus, it was suggested that the substance at the dose level of 100 mg/kg or more is toxic to the liver and the cerebellum ("Toxicity Testing Reports of Environmental Chemicals" (Chemicals Investigation Promoting Council) (access on Aug. 2009). Based on above information, the substance was classified into Category 2 (liver, brain).</rationale>
