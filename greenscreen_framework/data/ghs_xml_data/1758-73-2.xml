Therefore, the substance was classified as "Not classified". As relevant information, from in vitro mutagenicity tests, there are reports of positive results in two Ames tests (OECD TG471) (SIDS (access on Oct. 2009, "Toxicity Testing Reports of Environmental Chemicals" (Chemicals Investigation Promoting Council) (access on Oct. 2009)), and a CHL/IU cell chromosomal aberration test (OECD TG473 (GLP)) ("Toxicity Testing Reports of Environmental Chemicals" (Chemicals Investigation Promoting Council) (access on Oct. 2009)).

    <rationale>As effects on the respiratory system, in a rat 4-hour inhalation test (aerosol) (OECD TG403 (GLP)), clinical observations included difficulties in breathing, anemia and cyanosis as well as low locomotion at dose levels of 0.117 mg/L and higher. Necropsy revealed hemorrhages in the lungs at dose levels of 0.059 mg/L and higher, and histopathology revealed a corrosive action in the lung (multifocal fibrosis, inflammation, edema, congestion, loss of cilia etc.) at dose levels of 0.059 mg/L and higher. Trachea and nasal cavity were also affected (the details is not clear) (SIDS (access on Oct. 2009)). As effects on the kidney, in a rat oral test (OECD TG401 (GLP)), histopathology revealed grayish white in cortico-medullary junction area, basophilic renal tubule and interstitial fibrosis at dose levels of 1280 mg/kg and higher ("Toxicity Testing Reports of Environmental Chemicals" (Chemicals Investigation Promoting Council) (access on Oct. 2009)). Additionally, as narcotic effects, in a rat oral test, sedation, ataxia and reduced reflexes were observed at a dose level of 1120 mg/kg (SIDS (access on Oct. 2009).

In a combined repeat dose and reproductive/developmental toxicity test with rats (OECD TG422 (GLP)), at a dose level of 100 mg/kg (90-day equivalence: 54.4 mg/kg), effects on the liver including centrilobular hypertrophy of hepatocytes, basophilic material in the bile duct, vacuolization of hepatocytes, changes in blood chemical examination (increases of albumin, A/G ratio, triglycerides and phospholipids, decreases of glucose) and effects on the kidney including necrosis of the tubules, basophilic tubules, changes in blood chemical examination (increases of BUN, creatinine and inorganic phosphorus, decreases of potassium) were noted ("Toxicity Testing Reports of Environmental Chemicals" (Chemicals Investigation Promoting Council) (access on Oct. 2009)). Based on the above information, the substance was classified into Category 2 (liver, kidney). As relevant information, although edema, pneumonia, emphysema and atelectasis in the lung, hyperplasia and metaplasia in the spleen, and desquamation of the follicle epithelium in the thyroid were noted in a rat 9-month inhalation test (IUCLID (2000)), the results were not used as the basis of classification since exposure period per day was unclear.</rationale>
