    <rationale>Since it was classified into Group 3 according to IARC (IARC 73, 1999), it was set as the outside of Category. In addition, in pesticide registration trial in Japan, incidence of mammary gland tumors increased for females which received 70 - 1000ppm in the carcinogenicity tests using rat (Agricultural Chemical Registration Data, 1987). But in the test using rat which was performed in after years, generating of the tumor relevant to dose even at the dose of a maximum of 400ppm was not seen (Agricultural Chemical Registration Data, 1995). Moreover, in carcinogenicity tests using mice, generating of the tumor relevant to administration up to 3000ppm was not observed (Agricultural Chemical Registration Data, 1989). And as a result of estimation by the pesticide residues safety assessment committees, it is concluded that there is no fear of carcinogenicity to humans.   </rationale>

    <rationale>Reproductive toxicity was not observed in the two-generation reproduction study using rats (Agricultural Chemical Registration Data , 1989). 
However, in the teratogenicity test, in the highest dose group where mild toxic effect was observed in the mother animals, the increase in the iincomplete ossification of embryo was observed (Agricultural Chemical Registration Data , 1989). 
Moreover, also in teratogenicity test on rabbits, in the highest dose group where mild toxic effect was observed in the mother animals, the increase of delayed ossification rate of embryo were observed (Agricultural Chemical Registration Data, 1987). 
Since these were slight influences, they were out of the Category according to the guideline. 
In addition, as a result of being evaluated in the Committee for Safety Evaluation of Residual Pesticides, it is concluded that there is no effect of reproductive toxicity in humans.

This dose is guidance value within the Category 2. Moreover, in the subacute toxicity study (13-week treatment) using rat, the hemosiderin deposition of the spleen was observed at 500 ppm (equivalent: 34.0 mg/kg (male), 35.3 mg/kg (female)) (Agricultural Chemical Registration Data, 2005).
