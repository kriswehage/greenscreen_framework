    <rationale>In the 4th volume of MOE Risk Assessment (2005), it has been described that "the short term exposure slightly irritates the skin and causes redness of the skin" as an impact to humans. For animals, although it has been described that "fume may produce mild irritation on the skin" (EHC 202 (1998)), there was no description of "fume" in the cited literature (National Institute of Public Health and Environmental Protection (1989)) and experimental conditions could not be confirmed. Therefore, this data cannot be adopted. Moreover, although there is a description of "slightly irritating with Draize score of 0.79" (EU-RAR (2007)) in a 24-hour coating test employing rabbits (US Code of Federal Regulations), the result is from 10% solution. As mentioned above, classification is not possible with insufficient data. </rationale>

It has been described that it has "non-irritant" (EU-RAR (2007)) for animals since "In the medication test to the conjunctival sac employing rabbits (US Code of Federal Regulations), there is no influence to cornea and iris, slight to moderate redness of conjunctiva was seen in 4/6 rabbits, and Draize score is 1.0. Moreover, there is also a description of "no cornea damage" (EU-RAR (2007)) in the dropping test to conjunctival sac employing a rabbit. According to Fig. 3.3.1 of the U.N. GHS second edition, it was classified into Category 2 employing the human data described in EU-RAR (2007) which is the information source of List1. </rationale>

On the other hand, it has been described that "skin sensitization to ultraviolet stimulation increased" in the test processing with this substance followed by ultraviolet exposure to hairless mice and guinea pig (EHC202 (1998)). Also for humans, there are two cases reporting that "redness, hives, or pomphus was observed" by ultraviolet irradiation after the skin application of the substance (the 4th volume of MOE risk assessment (2005)), and in one of them, it has been described that "redness was not observed in the control group only with ultraviolet irradiation" (the 4th volume of MOE risk assessment (2005)). Therefore, the substance was classified as Category 1 since it was presumed to indicate photosensitizing to human skin.</rationale>

    <rationale>Since it is estimated the group 3 by IARC (IARC 32 (1983)) and the carcinogenicity classification D by EPA (IRIS (1991)), they are equivalent to "Not classified". However, after these evaluations by international evaluation organizations were done, the two-year oral administration test employing rats and mice was carried, which showed the increased incidence of tumors on liver of male rats and female mice, on bladder of male rats, and on kidney, bladder, womb, and mammary gland of female rats. Since there is a description that "positive carcinogenicityity was indicated" in male and female rats and female mice (Health, Labor and Welfare Ministry carcinogenicityity studies (1998)), based on this zoic tests data, it classified into Category 2. About humans, there is a description that "epithelioma was not produced" in workers who got in contact with the pure quality of this article (EU-RAR (2007)). </rationale>

However, it was not adopted as classified evidence since "headache, nausea, and reaction delay"cannot be regarded as material impacts. As for animals, it is described that "sprays exposure by this article stimulates an airway" (EHC 202 (1998)). As mentioned above, it classified into Category 3 (Respiratory tract irritation). In addition, the influence of congestion etc. at liver, lien and kidneys, etc. were looked in oral or dermal administration test using rats, mice, rabbit, etc. (EU-RAR (2007)), however, they were not adopted since the conditions in the concentration were well exceeding the guidance value of Category 2. </rationale>
