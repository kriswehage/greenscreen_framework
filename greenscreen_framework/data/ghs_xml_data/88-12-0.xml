    <rationale>IARC (1999), NICNAS (2000), and EU-RAR (2003) have reported the liver cell cancer, adenoma and glandular cancer of a nasal cavity, and the squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx in rats which were exposed by inhalation. Although IARC (1999) was defined as Goup 3 since the evidence of carcinogenicityity in animals was restrictive, EU-RAR (2003) and NICNAS (2000) are defined as Carcinogenicityity Category 3, R40 due to the fact that carcinogenesis tests have not been performed in animal species other than rats and that whether the carcinogenicityity is specific to the species (rats) cannot be determined, and also the fact that carcinogenicityity in humans cannot be denied only from the rat tumors since the carcinogenicity mechanism is not clear even though it is caused by nongenotoxic mechanism. Adopting the view of EU-RAR (2003) and NICNAS (2000), it was defined as Category 2. In addition, ACGIH (2003) reported that lung adenomas besides tumors in liver, nasal cavity, laryngeal were observed in the rats after inhalation exposure, and it was classified as A3, equivalent to the GHS Category 2. </rationale>

    <rationale>According to EU-RAR (2003), the Narcotic effects and tiredness in humans exposed by inhalation were reported. Moreover, since nasal mucus and a slight membrane stimulus were observed in animals (e.g. rats) of inhalation administration test, it was classified into Category 3 (Narcotic effects, Respiratory tract irritation). In addition, EU-Annex I is Xi; R 37-41, and is equivalent to Respiratory tract irritation. Moreover, although liver and kidney are made into targets organ in dissection of the death animal, the influence on those internal organs is not deemed in dissection of the survival animal (EU-RAR (2003)). </rationale>

    <rationale>There is a report of olfactory epithelial atrophy in mice subjected to inhalation exposure of 5 ppm (corresponding 90-day value: 0.0089 mg/L) or greater and rats subjected to inhalation exposure of 15 ppm (corresponding value for 90 days: 0.027 mg/L) or greater in EU-RAR (2003). Catarrhal rhinitis and localized effects on the respiratory system such as minute changes to the nasal cavity, larynx, trachea, lungs, etc. have also been observed. Therefore, it was classified as Category 1 (respiratory system). Effects on liver cells of the rats treated with inhalation of a dose of 10 ppm for three months, including the enlargement of the liver cells were found (NICNAS (2000)) and the increasing weight of liver and the liver centrilobular necrobiosis were observed in rats and mice treated with inhalation of a dose of 15 ppm (corresponding value of 90 days=0.027 mg/L) (EU-RAR (2003)). Moreover, in EU-RAR (2003), it is concluded that inhalation exposure of 5 ppm and more has cytopathic effects on the liver of mice and rats. Therefore, it is defined as Category 1 (liver). According to EU-RAR (2003), decrease in the erythrocyte count, hemoglobin value and hematocrit value is statistically significant in the rats treated with inhalation of a dose of 10 ppm (exposure period of three months or more, corresponding value of 90 days=0.045 mg/L) or 15 ppm (corresponding value of 90 days=0.027 mg/L) or more, which may result in anemia. Moreover, since increase in the platelet count was found (EU-RAR (2003)), it was defined as Category 1 (blood system). </rationale>
