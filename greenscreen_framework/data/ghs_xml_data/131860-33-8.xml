Similarly, unscheduled DNA synthesis tests using rat hepatocytes (in vivo genotoxicity tests using somatic cells) gave negative results.

Similarly, in oral administration tests conducted during the organogenetic period using rats (GLP-compliant), no signs of teratogenicity were detected at the doses that showed general toxicity in parental animals (A pesticide abstract and evaluation report (Food and Agricultural Materials Inspection Center) (2008, 2006)). Also, in oral administration tests conducted during the organogenetic period using rabbits (GLP-compliant), no effects of this substance on number of embryos in the uterus, growth, survival rate, and development were noted at the doses that showed general toxicity in parental animals, as well as no effects on incidences of malformation and variation being detected (A pesticide abstract and evaluation report (Food and Agricultural Materials Inspection Center) (2008, 2006)).

    <rationale>In 90-day repeated exposure tests via mixed diet using rats (GLP-compliant), effects of the exposure on the liver such as a marked increase in GGT activity and increased liver weight were noted, and as histopathological observations, hyperplasia of the intrahepatic bile duct or bile ductule, and oval cells, and cholangitis of the extrahepatic bile duct were detected at 4000 ppm (444 mg/kg/day for male and 449 mg/kg/day for female) (A pesticide abstract and evaluation report (Food and Agricultural Materials Inspection Center) (2008, 2006)). In addition, in chronic toxicity / carcinogenicity joint tests using rats that underwent mixed diet administration for 104 weeks (GLP-compliant), dilatation of the common bile duct as related to administration was observed for male animals in 1500 ppm (108.6 mg/kg/d) groups that died during the experiment. With this change, an increase in incidences of bile duct epithelial hyperplasia and cholangitis in the liver were noted. The bile duct is considered as the primary target organ of this substance, and its effects were seen in males only, not females. Because cases of male mortality in 1500 ppm (108.6 mg/kg/d) groups increased during the experiment, the dose was considered to be above the maximum tolerated dose. Consequently, the dose was lowered to 750 ppm (34 mg/kg/d) for only male rats from week 53 of the experiment. Since the dose was lowered, no effects related to administration were noted (A pesticide abstract and evaluation report (Food and Agricultural Materials Inspection Center) (2008, 2006)). The effects of the substance on the bile duct were detected in both studies mentioned above; however, doses tested exceeded Category 2 guidance values in 90-day repeated exposure tests, and effects of the substance were detected only in dead animals in combined 104-week chronic toxicity / carcinogenicity tests. Thus, these results were not used for classification of the substance. Moreover, only oral administration test results are available. NOAEL of 1000 mg/kg/day is documented in 21-day dermal exposure tests (Pesticide Fact Sheet (1997)), but details of the test are not provided. Furthermore, there are no data from inhalation exposure tests. Thus, classification is not possible.</rationale>
