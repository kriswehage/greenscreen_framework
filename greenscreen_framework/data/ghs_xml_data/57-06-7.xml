Transitional-cell papillomas in the urinary bladder occurred in dosed male rats but not in control male rats, and fibrosarcomas in the subcutaneous tissue occurred in female rats, but no increased incidences of tumors were observed in mice. It was concluded that under the condition of this test, the substance was carcinogenic for male rats, equivocal for female rats and not carcinogenic for mice (NTP TR234 (1982)).</rationale>

    <rationale>In a developmental toxicity test by oral administration to rats during organogenesis period, there was no effect on fetuses at a dose at which general toxicity is manifested in maternal animals (IARC 73 (1999)). However, in developmental toxicity tests by oral administration to mice, hamsters, and rabbits during organogenesis period, no evidence of treatment-related maternal toxicity and teratogenicity were observed in any species, but there was some increase in the incidence of dead fetuses and resorbed embryos in mice at the highest dose (IARC 73 (1999)). Although the substance corresponds to Category 1B based on toxicity at a dose at which general toxicity is not manifested in maternal animals, the substance was classified into Category 2 since the toxicity was observed in mice only.</rationale>

    <rationale>In rats receiving orally 200 - 400 mg/kg, inactivity, watery eyes and ruffled fur were observed. After oral administration to mice, death occurred at dose levels of 400 mg/kg and higher. Toxic signs such as inactivity and ruffled fur were observed at dose levels of 100 mg/kg and higher, and dose related thicken and necrosis in mucosal surface of the stomach were noted (NTP TR (1982)). In another rat oral test (HSDB (2003)), rats were exhausted and died within 4-hour to 15 days after administration. The LD50 value was determined to be 339 mg/kg. As in the other tests, death and signs such as inactivity, ruffled fur and exhaustion, and gross lesions such as thicken and necrosis in mucosal surface of the stomach were observed at dose levels of 300 - 400 mg/kg or higher, within the guidance value range for Category 2.

    <rationale>In a rat 14-day oral test, all rats died at dose levels of 200 and 400 mg/kg (90-day equivalence: 31.1 and 62.2 mg/kg/day). Gross pathological lesions such as thickened mucosal surface of the stomach and adhesion of the stomach to the peritoneum and toxic signs such as inactivity and ruffled fur were observed at dose levels of 50 - 400 mg/kg (7.8 - 62.2 mg/kg/day) (NTP TR 234 (1982)). In a mouse 14-day oral test, one mouse died, and gross pathological lesions such as thickened mucosal surface of the stomach and thickened urinary bladder wall were observed at a dose level of 50 mg/kg/day (7.8 mg/kg/day) (NTP TR 234 (1982)). On the other hand, in rat and mouse 13-week oral tests, no exposure-related effects were observed in either species, and the NOEL was reported to be the highest dose tested (25 mg/kg/day) (NTP TR 234 (1982)). In summary, for rats, deaths were observed at dose levels of 200 mg/kg/day (90-day equivalence: 31.1 mg/kg/day) and higher. Changes in the stomach and toxic signs were observed at dose levels of 50 mg/kg/day (90-day equivalence: 7.8 mg/kg/day) and higher. For mice, one death and changes in the stomach and urinary bladder were observed at 50 mg/kg/day (90-day equivalence: 7.8 mg/kg/day).
