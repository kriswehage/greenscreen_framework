    <rationale>The rabbit tests resulted in that the substance was not irritating (Hazard Assessment Report (CERI, NITE) (2006)). In addition, administration of the substance, 20% solution or undiluted, caused slight or no irritation (DFGOT vol.19 (2003)). Based on these results, the substance was classified into "Not classified". As relevant notes, in primary skin irritation tests following the Draize test procedure with occlusive application of the substance to the skin of rabbits for 24 hours, the substance was moderately irritating (Hazard Assessment Report (CERI, NITE) (2006)). In addition, some commercial products containing the substance may cause irritation.</rationale>

    <rationale>Two patients with allergic contact dermatitis and respiratory symptoms such as rhinitis and asthma tested positive by prick tests (DFGOT vol.19 (2003). In addition, cement workers, who repeatedly exhibited contact dermatitis by exposure to this substance, were suspected to have occupational asthma, which turned out to be mild bronchial hyperreactivity. However, there was not sufficient data to support that respiratory allergies were caused by this substance (DFGOT vol.19 (2003)). Since both cases were not concluded to be positive reactions due to the substance, classification is not possible.</rationale>

    <rationale>Two kinds of skin sensitization tests using guinea pigs (maximization test and Buehler test) were conducted and both tests yielded positive results (DFGOT vol.19 (2003)). Furthermore, according to epidemiological studies, many people who were exposed to epoxy resin that contains this substance developed allergic contact dermatitis (CERI / NITE hazard assessment reports (2006), DFGOT vol.19 (2003)). Some of these studies concluded that this substance caused skin sensitization (CERI / NITE hazard assessment reports (2006)). In addition to these positive results documented, the substance has been categorized into R43 in the EU classification, and Sh in the DFG classification, both of which indicate it is skin sensitizing. Thus, the substance was classified into Category 1.</rationale>

Based on these results, the substance was classified into "Not classified". Among in vitro tests, positive results have been documented from reverse mutation tests using bacteria, mutation tests using mouse lymphoma cells, and chromosomal aberration tests (DFGOT vol.19 (2003)).</rationale>

Furthermore, in developmental toxicity tests using rats or rabbits that underwent oral route exposure during the organogenetic period, mild toxicity was detected in maternal animals at high administration doses, but no adverse effects on the development of offspring and teratogenicity were observed (DFGOT vol.19 (2003)). Since no adverse effects of the substance on reproductive functions and fertility have been detected in reproductive and developmental toxicity tests, the substance was classified into "Not classified".</rationale>

    <rationale>In the oral administration tests using rats that were applied with the substance at 1000mg/kg/day for 28 days (90-day conversion: 311mg/kg/day) or at 1500mg/kg/day for 90 days, no toxic effects were observed other than reduced body weight (DFGOT vol.19 (2003)). Similarly, the tests in which rats underwent oral administration (diet containing the substance) for 26 weeks did not yield significant toxicological changes, and the NOAEL was determined to be 100mg/kg/day (Hazard Assessment Report (CERI, NITE) (2006)). In addition, in the dermal route exposure tests using mice that were applied with doses up to 1000mg/kg/day for 13 weeks, no changes in skin were observed other than localized effects (Hazard Assessment Report (CERI, NITE) (2006)). In the tests using rats, no toxic effects of the substance were detected other than suppressed amounts of food intake and decreased body weight gain (Hazard Assessment Report (CERI, NITE) (2006)). In the tests in which test animals were dermally exposed to the substance up to 1000mg/kg/day for 103 weeks, there were no significant changes observed compared with control groups other than effects due to skin irritation (Hazard Assessment Report (CERI, NITE) (2006)). From these results, no systemic toxicity was observed at the doses higher than the upper limit of Category 2 guidance values (100-1000mg/kg/day) in all of the oral and dermal administration tests using rats or mice with different exposure periods. Although these results indicated that the substance was to be classified into "Not classified" (oral and dermal routes), in conclusion, the substance was classified into "Classification not possible" due to lack of information on inhalation route exposure.</rationale>
