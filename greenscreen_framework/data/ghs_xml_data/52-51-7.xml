On the other hand, in human patch tests, 0.25% and 1% in Vaseline, or a 0.25% aqueous solution, showed mild irritation (DFGOT vol. 2 (1991)).

    <rationale>It is documented that in rats, after exposure by the dermal route, labored breathing and lung congestion were noted, and after inhalation exposure (mist), respiratory organ signs were noted, such as dyspnea and pneumonitis (HSDB (2004)). However, since the test does not provide the onset dose or exposure duration, it is not possible to classify the substance into Category 1 or 2. But, based on the description that inhalation (mist) caused dyspnea (HSDB), the substance was classified into Category 3 (respiratory tract irritation).</rationale>

    <rationale>In a 13-week oral administration test using rats, at doses of 80 mg/kg/day or more, high mortality was noted, and most animals showed respiratory distress (gasping, wheezing), and gaseous and fluid distention of the gastrointestinal tract was seen at autopsy. At the dose of 160 mg/kg/day, signs became severer, and hemorrhagic foci in and raised white areas on the mucosa of the glandular stomach occurred (HSDB (2004)). Many rats exhibited GI lesions (superficial ulceration with underlying inflammation, epithelial hyperplasia and hyperkeratosis), and mortality became higher (HSDB (2004)). In addition, in the kidneys, distended or dilated tubules with eosinophilic material were seen in males in treatment groups (HSDB (2004)). However, stomach lesions were considered to be topical effects by irritation of the substance, and changes in the kidneys might be hyaline droplet degeneration by alpha2u globulin accumulation, unique to male rats, and they were not evaluated. As for effects on the respiratory system causing respiratory distress, since it was noted at the dose of 80 mg/kg/day or more, the substance was classified into Category 2 (respiratory system). As relevant information, other tests with oral or percutaneous administration using rats and other animal species were conducted (DFGOT vol.2 (1991), HSDB (2004)). However, none of the data obtained were considered to be sufficient for classification evidence.</rationale>
