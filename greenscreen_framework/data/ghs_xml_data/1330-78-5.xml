Although the number of child animals per litter and their survival capability decreased, no effect on the generation was observed (EHC 110 (1990)), and after thorough review of the primary literature (Toxicology, 46 (1987)), it was classified in Category 1B, since there is a description as follows, "Neither of female and male parent animals showed clinical symptoms and body weight decrease." </rationale>

In addition, there is no animal data for this article (isomer mixture).

For animals, although there is a description of "Authors concluded that hazard was low in the short term since the impact was not seen histopathologically" in the three months oral administration test employing rats by the pharmacy which hardly contains o-isomer (EHC 110 (1990)), it has been described that, in the test where this substance containing 1% o-isomer was administered orally for 13 weeks forcibly or administered with feed to the rat, "the cytoplasmic vacuolization of the adkidney adrenal gland were seen dose-dependently" in both cases. (NTP TR433 (1994)) and the impact on the adrenal gland were seen within the range of guidance of Category 2. Although it was thought that the hazard varied greatly depending on the content of o-isomer, priority was given to the the human case exposed to 6-10% of o-isomer for the nervous system, and it was classified into Category 1 (nervous system) and Category 2 (adrenal gland). </rationale>
