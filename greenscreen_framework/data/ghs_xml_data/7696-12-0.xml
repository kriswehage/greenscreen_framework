However, the tumor of the cell between testis occurs spontaneously in elderly rats, and the incidence may change a lot within the control. There is no proof that this tumor is malignant, and tumor generating of this type is not proved in the mouse. Therefore, it will not be thought that it is possibly generated in relation to the human exposure, even if this oncogenicity is a fact" (EHC 98 (1990)). </rationale>

    <rationale>In EHC 98 (1990) it was reported that "weight reduction of the pituitary gland and thyroid/parathyroid gland and reduction of lien weight in males" were observed in a 104-week feeding study in mice. Moreover, in a 6-month feeding study in rats, it was reported that "increased serum calcium levels and reduced hepatic lipid content in males and a slight increase in urinary protein and increases in relative weight of kidneys and liver weights in males and females" within the range of guidance values for Category 2 were observed. For liver symptoms, it is pointed out that "it is an adaptive change related to the addition of corn oil to the feed" (EHC 98 (1990)). Also, for other organs no effects apart from weight loss have not been observed and no serious symptoms are thought to occur. From the above, none of these organs can be considered as target organs, but the possibility cannot be completely ruled out that exposure to this substance will affect human health, so classification is not possible. </rationale>
