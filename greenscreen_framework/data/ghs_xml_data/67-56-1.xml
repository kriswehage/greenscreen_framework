The calculation value was 7939mg/kg, and it was judged to be the outside of Category from the result of the animal experiments. On the other hand,  there is description that the toxicity of methanol appears highly in primates compared with rodent (EHC 196 (1997)). And the dose leading to death in an about half in humans is 1400mg/kg (DFGOT vol.16 (2001)), it was set as Category 5.</rationale>

Skin: Although there is a description (PATTY (4th, 1994)) which cited two or more articles reporting allergic contact dermatitis in human skin evidence of exposure, there is no description on the concrete cases. On the other hand, there are descriptions (EHC 196 (1997) and DFGOT vol.16 (2001)) that sensitization was not identified in the Magnusson-Kligman maximization test using the guinea pigs. Since data was insufficient for judging the existence of skin sensitization from these information, it could not be classified.</rationale>

    <rationale>Since although there are descriptions that increase in fetal malformation or fetal death was observed in an oral and inhalation exposure test using pregnant rats and mice (EHC 196 (1997), ACGIH (7th, 2001), DFGOT vol.16 (2001) and PATTY (4th, 1994)) and there is no reliable data of human examples of exposures, it was classified into class 1B. 
There are descriptions that decrease in testosterone concentration or testicular degeneration was observed in male rats (EHC 196 (1997), DFGOT vol.16 (2001), and PATTY (4th, 1994)). 
On the contrary, however, some descriptions of any effects on reproductive tract of males were not observed, and so effects on the reproductive ability of males are not clear.

    <rationale>According to the descriptions that central nervous system depression and visual organ disorder are observed by acute oral or inhalation exposure by humans (EHC 196 (1997), ACGIH (7th, 2001), DFGOT vol.16 (2001), PATTY (4th, 1994) and Japan Society for Occupational Health Recommendations of Occupational Exposure Limits (1993)), and that metabolic acidosis is observed in human evidence of exposure (ACGIH (7th, 2001) and DFGOT vol.16 (2001)), their targets were judged to be the central nervous system, visual organs, and systemic toxicity, and they were all set as Category 1. Moreover, based on the descriptions that respiratory irritation was observed by the repeated inhalation exposure tests with rats (EHC 196 (1997) and PATTY (4th, 1994)) and that mucosal irritation is observed in humans (Japan Society for Occupational Health Recommendation of Occupational Exposure Limits), and since the anesthetic actions were identified by the rat, mouse, Macaca mulatta, etc., (EHC 196 (1997) and PATTY (4th, 1994)).
