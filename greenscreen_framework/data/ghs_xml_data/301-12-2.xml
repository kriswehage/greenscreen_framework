    <rationale>A Chinese hamster chromosomal aberration test using bone marrow cells receiving single-dose oral gavage administration (in vivo mutagenicity test using somatic cells) yielded negative results (HSDB (2004)), while mouse chromosomal aberration tests using bone marrow cells receiving intraperitoneal administration (in vivo mutagenicity test using somatic cells) induced chromatid breaks and gaps (no exchange type abberration was reported) (all from HSDB (2004)). The negative results by oral administration were obtained with the single-dose of 40 mg/kg and with a doubtful methodology, while positive results by IP administration (1 - 3 mg/kg) contained chromatid gaps and their evaluation is difficult. It is documented that a mouse dominant lethal test with intraperitoneal administration (4.5 mg/kg) yielded negative results, a rat dominant lethal test with oral administration (0.15 - 5 mg/kg) showed negative results, and a mouse oral administration test (28 - 80 mg/kg) induced micronuclei, chromosomal aberrations, and abnormal sperm heads. Based on the above results, the effects on germ cells can be denied, but the effects on somatic cells cannot be determined, therefore, the substance was classified into Category 2. As relevant information, an in vitro mutagenicity test, an Ames test, a chromosomal aberration test using human lymphcytes, a mouse lymphoma assay, and a chromosomal aberration test using the CHO cell line (HSDB (2004)) yielded positive results.</rationale>

    <rationale>A rat developmental toxicity test with oral administration during the organogenetic period did not indicate developmental toxicity (JMPR 1004 (2002)), and another rat oral administration test during the organogenetic period showed fetal hypoplasia and dysplasia of the testes, which are considered to be caused by parental toxicities (JMPR 699 (1984)). While, a male rat reproductive toxicity test by oral gavage yielded reduced female pregnancy rates (JMPR 1004 (2002)), a two-generation reproduction study in rats indicated vacuolation of the corpus of the epididymis, decreased corpus luteum, and reduced litter size (JMPR 1004 (2002)), and a rat three-generation reproduction test showed a reduced number of pregnancies and a reduced number of young per litter in all generations (JMPR 102 (1967)). Therefore, the substance was classified into Category 2.

    <rationale>A rat oral administration test at a single dose of 2.5 - 50 mg/kg by gavage showed at all doses, reductions in plasma, erythrocyte, and brain cholinestrase activity, and at the time of peak effect, the reduction was 55 - 61%, and at the doses of 10 mg/kg or higher, toxic symptoms caused by cholinestrase inhibition were seen (JMPR 1004 (2002)). A human test orally exposed at 0.0125 - 2 mg/kg did not show symptoms of anti-cholinestrase toxicity; however, at doses of 1 mg/kg and higher, reductions in plasma and erythrocyte cholinestrase activity were seen, and at the maximum, they reduced to that of approximately 70% of the control group (JMPR (2002)). Also, case reports have been made, and in a case, a woman attempted to commit suicide by ingesting half a bottle (12 g), and admitted to the hospital, experienced signs including miosis, hyperreflex, muscular fasciculations, and coma, and her plasma cholinestrase level fell to 10% of the normal level (HSDB (2004)). As described above, cholinestrase inhibition and nervous symptoms based on the inhibition was seen in rats at doses equivalent to the guidance value of Category 1, and also in humans, not only cholinestrase inhibition but also cholinergic signs in accident cases have been reported, and therefore, the substance was classified into Category 1 (nervous system).</rationale>

    <rationale>In a rat neurotoxicity test with gavage administration for 15 days (doses; 2.5, 10, 50 mg/kg), at a dose equivalent to the guidance value of Category 1, indicated tremors, ataxic gait, decreased number of rearings, pinpoint pupils, decreased body temperature, and decreased motor activity were observed, and inhibition of brain cholinestrase activity was found (HSDB (2004)). Furthermore, in a neurotoxicity test using rats with oral administration for 13-weeks (doses: 0.062, 0.62, and 5.4 mg/kg for males; 0.074, 0.75, and 6.6 mg/kg for females), at the dose equivalent to the guidance value of Category 1, tremors, aggressive behavior, decreased hindlimb grip strength, a decrease in body temperature, and inhibition of plasma, erythrocyte, and brain cholinesterase activities were observed (HSDB (2004)). In addition, in a 21-month oral administration test using mice (JMPR 1004 (2002)), in a 21-day oral administration test using rats (JMPR 102 (1967)), in a 6-month oral administration test using rats (HSDB (2004)), and in a 14-day oral administration test by gavage using rats (HSDB (2004)), at a dose equivalent to the guidance value of Category 1, inhibition of erythrocyte and brain cholinestrase activities were observed, and also in human volunteers, inhibition of plasma and erythrocyte cholinestrase activities were observed (HSDB (2004)). Therefore, the substance was classified into Category 1 (nervous system).
