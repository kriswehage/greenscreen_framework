Given that its vapour pressure is 30 mbar at 20degC (Hommel (1996)), its saturated concentration is approximately 30000 ppm.

    <rationale>In the study using 6 rabbits, necrosis was observed in all test animals (PATTY (5th, 2001)). In other animal tests, the substance was reported to have a corrosive effect (HSDB (2008)). Furthermore, in human accident cases, severe epithelial damage and chemical burns were reported with the substance in contact with skin for no longer than 3 minutes (PATTY (5th, 2001)). Based on this information on animals and humans, the substance was classified into Category 1. Its pH = 12.6 (20degC, 100 g/L) (GESTIS (accessed in November 2008)) and it is rated as R34 in the EU classification.</rationale>

In other tests on rabbit eyes, the substance caused severe injury of the cornea, graded 9 on a scale of 1 to 10 (HSDB (2008)). Furthermore, a corrosive effect on the eyes of rabbits is also reported in a different study (HSDB (2008)). Based on these positive results, the substance was classified into Category 1. Its pH = 12.6 (20degC, 100 g/L) (GESTIS (accessed in November 2008)) and its classification for skin corrosion / irritation is Category 1.</rationale>

    <rationale>In four clinical cases of allergic contact dermatitis due to wearing rubber gloves, two patch-tested patients were found to be hypersensitive to piperidine, which is a constituent of the material from which the rubber gloves were made (HSDB (2008)). However, in workers handling piperidine at work, no cases of skin sensitization were observed in the period from 1989 to 1998 (HSDB (2008)). Since it is not clear if reported contact dermatitis cases are attributed to this substance, classification is not possible.</rationale>

    <rationale>In the mouse micronucleus test (in vivo mutagenicity tests using somatic cells), an oral administration of maximum tolerated dose of piperidine yielded negative results (HSDB (2008)).

Regarding in vitro tests, Some of Ames tests and forward mutation tests using mouse lymphoma cells gave positive results (HSDB (2008)).</rationale>

    <rationale>No indications of carcinogenicity were found in several tests in which mice received intraperitoneal injection for 6.5 weeks, rats were given 0.1% piperidine in their drinking water for 75 weeks, or rats were given 0.09% piperidine in their drinking water for 50 weeks (HSDB (2008)). However, some improper test procedures were used, which were inconsistent with the current test guidelines. For instance, only one dose was used in each of these tests, and the duration of administration was short. So, it is questionable to classify the substance into the "Not classified" category based on negative results obtained in these studies above. For that reason, the substance was classified into the "Classification not possible" category.</rationale>

    <rationale>In rats that underwent inhalation exposure to piperidine on day 4 of pregnancy, the number of implantation sites and the number of fetuses per female decreased as well as suppressed body weight gain being observed (all changes were statistically significant) (HSDB (2008)). In other rat tests, 4-month exposure caused altered spermatogenesis in male rats and an increase in the resorption rate in female rats (HSDB (2008)). As above, since signs of reproductive toxicity, such as decrease in the number of implantation sites and the number of fetuses per female, and an increase in the resorption rate, were observed at the doses that induce general toxicity in parental animals, the substance was classified into Category 2.</rationale>

    <rationale>After oral administration, weakness, respiratory distress, and convulsions were seen in rats treated with 100 mg/kg (PATTY (5th, 2001)). In other study, toxic symptoms such as decreased motor activity, tremors, and respiratory effects were noted at 5-2000 mg/kg; and decreased motor activity, tremors, respiratory effects, ataxia, and salivation were noted at doses around the LD50 value (337 mg/kg) (HSDB (2008)). It is documented that piperidine causes excitation or inhibition of synapses in the central nervous system (GESTIS (accessed in November 2008)). Overall, this substance presumably induces toxic symptoms in the nervous system, and these symptoms appear at doses as low as 100 mg/kg. As such, the substance was classified into Category 1 (central nervous system).</rationale>

    <rationale>In rats or rabbits that received repeated inhalation exposure to piperidine 4 hours a day for 4 months showed the following changes at 0.01 mg/L (2.87 ppm) (6 hours/day-correction value: 0.008 mg/L or 2.34 ppm): renal dysfunction (lower daily diuresis), scars in the myocardium including necrotic areas, thickening of alveolar walls, protein dystrophy in the liver, hyaline droplet degeneration in the kidneys (HSDB (2008)). On the other hand, in the 4-week repeated inhalation exposure study using rats (OECD TG 412), except for a slight increase in relative liver weights and a tendency towards retardation of body weight gain being observed at 0.348 mg/L (100 ppm) (90-day correction value: 0.107 mg/L or 30.8 ppm), no effects of the substance, including neurotoxic effects, were detected (HSDB (2008)). Overall, while various adverse effects were observed in the 4-month study, they were not shown in the 4-week study in spite of the use of the high exposure concentration (0.107 mg/L), more than 10 times the concentration used in the 4-month test (0.008 mg/L). Since these results and data remain questionable in terms of their consistency and validity, the substance was classified into the "Classification not possible" category.</rationale>
