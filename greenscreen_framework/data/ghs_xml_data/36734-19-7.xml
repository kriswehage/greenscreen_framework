In 99-week oral administration (mixed diet) tests using mice, an increased incidence of benign or malignant liver tumors in both sexes, and an increased incidence of luteomas in the ovaries were observed. In 18-month oral administration (mixed diet) tests using mice, tumors observed were lymphosarcomas involving the spleen, lymph nodes and thymus (JMPR (1995). Furthermore, the substance is rated as Category 3 in the EU's carcinogenicity evaluations. All these reports considered, the substance was classified into Category 2.</rationale>

Moreover, in oral administration tests conducted using rats or rabbits during the oraganogenetic period, the number of implantation sites decreased in rat groups treated with the highest dose (400 mg/kg/day) that reduced body weight or food consumption of parental animals (JMPR (1992)); similarly, miscarriage and rates of postimplantation loss increased in rabbit groups treated with the highest dose (200 mg/kg/day) (JMPR (1992)).

    <rationale>In oral administration tests using rats, surviving animals treated at 2000 mg/kg or above comprised lethargy, decreased motor activity, prone posture, ataxia, unconsciousness, breathing irregularities, piloerection, ungroomed appearance, pigmented orbital secretion, hunched posture, thin body conformation, diarrhoea and reduced body temperature. At the doses of 900 or 1342 mg/kg, signs of lethargy, decreased motor activity, ataxia, and prone posture were observed (IUCLID (2000)). Based on these observations, the substance was classified into Category 2 (nervous system).
In dermal administration tests using rabbits, no abnormalities were detected in 8 of the 10 animals treated with 2000 mg/kg based on visual inspection; one of the two remaining animals (it is noted that this animal got cut around the neck and in the mouth during the experiment) showed red staining on the skin around the mouth, and clear discharge on fur around the nares, distended abdomen, as well as distended small intestines, cecum and stomach with abnormal contents and vascularized stomach and cecum. However, it is noted that these observations are not clearly attributable to iprodione (IUCLID (2000)). Furthermore, in inhalation tests using rats, clinical signs were unspecific at the dose of 5.16 mg/L/4h and they were observed on the day of exposure and up to 2 days after the exposure; the signs observed include blepharospasm, periocular and perinasal wetness, periocular and perinasal encrustation, unkempt fur, and white powder on the fur (IUCLID (2000)). However, these signs developed at the doses higher than the guidance values.</rationale>

    <rationale>The substance was classified into Category 2 (hematopoietic system) based on 52-week oral administration (mixed diet) tests using rats, in which incidence of extramedullary haematopoiesis and haemosiderosis increased in the spleens of female rats at 1600 ppm (conversion value: 80 mg/kg bw /day) (JMPR (1995)).
In 99-week oral administration (mixed diet) tests using mice, the kidney with irregular cortical scarring and altered shape were observed at a higher incidence in females at 4000 ppm; in the liver, an increased incidence of enlarged eosinophilic and fat-containing hepatocytes was observed in animals of each sex at the highest dose; and centrilobular hepatocyte enlargement was observed in female rats treated with 800 ppm (conversion value: 120 mg/kg bw /day) and both sexes treated with 4000 ppm. Pigmented macrophages and centrilobular hepatocyte vacuolation were found in males at 4000 ppm; and haemosiderosis in the spleen, amyloidosis, and cortical scarring in the kidneys were reported in female mice at the highest dose (JMPR (1995). In 28-day oral administration (mixed diet) tests, exposure to 6000 ppm or higher was associated with ataxia and lethargy; livers had a stippled appearance on gross examination, and the incidence of hepatocyte vacuolation and focal eosinophilic degeneration was increased at 6000 ppm or higher. At 15000 ppm, granulomatous inflammation (possibly in response to a foreign body) was observed in the heart, liver, and kidney (JMPR (1992). In 4-week oral administration (mixed diet) using mice, depression and ataxia were observed at 6000 ppm or higher. Gross necropsy revealed white foci in the liver of mice receiving 1900 ppm (male: 366 mg/kg bw /day; female: 439 mg/kg bw /day) and higher, a stippled appearance of the liver at 6000 ppm and higher, and liver enlargement at 9500 and 15000 ppm. White foci and granulomatous inflammation were observed in numerous tissues, primarily at the high dose. One granulomatous lesion was observed in the liver at 6000 ppm and five were observed in the bladder at 9500 ppm. The presence of spindle-shaped clear spaces in tissues and foreign body type giant cells suggested a reaction to crystal formation (JMPR (1992)). In 4-week oral administration (mixed diet) tests using mice, crystalline deposits and effects on the liver were observed at 6000 ppm or higher, and granulomatous lesions surrounding crystal deposits were found frequently in the urinary bladder and occasionally in liver parenchyma, myocardium, diaphragmatic muscle, and skeletal muscle. It was speculated that the crystals contained a major metabolite of iprodione (32490 R.P.), which was identified in the liver. Liver effects included increased weight, pale and mottled appearance on gross examination, and swelling of hepatocytes to form large homogeneous areas in the centrilobular region of the liver. Histopathological changes in the testes and spleen were observed at doses levels above 6000 ppm (JMPR (1992)). In 3-month oral administration (mixed diet) tests using rats, effects on the liver, spleen and thymus were observed at high doses in small examinations carried out (JMPR (1992)); however these observations were made on animals that received doses higher than guidance values.</rationale>
