Based on these outcomes, its rat LC50 (4 hours) is estimated to be 1.87-2.37mg/L, with these values equivalent to the Category 4 guidance values. Given that its saturated vapour concentration is 69.3 ppm (0.329mg/L), the tests were presumably conducted in mist states. By exposing rats for 7 hours, it was reported that LC0 = 1.25mg/L (4-hour correction: 2.19mg/L) and LC100 = 10.58mg/L (4-hour correction: 18.52mg/L) (SIDS (accessed in July 2008)).</rationale>

    <rationale>After the undiluted substance was applied to normal or damaged rabbit skins for 24 hours, extensive necrosis (epidermis), subcutaneous bleeding, and pitting edemas were observed (SIDS (accessed July 2008)). Necrosis was observed in several 24-hour application tests, concluding that the substance was highly irritating (SIDS (accessed July 2008)). However, in 4-hour application tests, the substance was concluded to be moderately irritating and not corrosive based on observations of moderate erythema and severe edemas, and necrosis of epidermis in 2 out of 6 treated rabbits (SIDS (accessed July 2008)). Based on the latter test results, the substance was classified into Category 2.</rationale>

    <rationale>After the undiluted substance was applied to the eyes of rabbits, the substance was concluded to be highly irritating, with observations of bulla, corrosion and/or ulceration, severe corneal necrosis, and blepharitis (SIDS (accessed July 2008)). In other rabbit tests, extensive conjunctivitis and corneal clouding were observed, concluding that the substance was highly irritating and may cause severe injury (Grade 5 on a scale of 1-10). These symptoms continued for 7 days after the application, suggesting possible permanent visual impairment (SIDS (accessed July 2008)). From these results that indicate its irreversible effects on the eyes, the substance was classified into Category 1.</rationale>

Furthermore, according to epidemiological studies and case reports, there have been many cases of positive reactions documented in humans who were previously exposed to acrylic compounds containing this substance and subsequently took patch tests (SIDS (accessed July 2008)).

    <rationale>No evidence of carcinogenicity was obtained in 18-month inhalation tests using rats (SIDS (accessed in July 2008)). Similarly, no evidence of carcinogenicity was found in 2-year oral route exposure tests using mice, in which incidences of tumors did not increase in treated mice (results from Carcinogenicity Studies (Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare) (2005)), However, in rats that underwent oral exposure for 2 years, basophilic micro foci increased in treated male rats, in the form of hepatocyte adenoma and preblastomatous lesions, which were considered to be a suggestive evidence of carcinogenic effects (Results from Carcinogenicity Studies(Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare)(2005)). Since rat oral tests yielded unclear conclusions, and rat inhalation tests and mouse oral test resulted negative, the substance was classified into "Not classified".</rationale>

    <rationale>In acute toxicity tests using rats that underwent oral administration, lowered levels of activity were observed as general symptoms at all doses tested. And in other tests, loss of righting reflexes were documented (SIDS (accessed in July 2008)). In addition, lethargy was observed at all doses tested in acute toxicity tests using rabbits that underwent dermal administration (SIDS (accessed in July 2008)). Based on these results, the substance was classified into Category 3 (narcotic effects). In terms of respiratory irritation, exposing rats via inhalation for 8 hours under saturated vapour pressure did not cause mortality, but was associated with dyspnea and severe irritation of the mucous membranes (SIDS (accessed in July 2008)). Also, inhalation exposure at 3 ppm caused irritation of the nasal cavities, and cases of respiratory tract irritation among plant workers have been documented (SIDS (accessed in July 2008)).

    <rationale>In 28-day inhalation exposure (vapour) tests using rats, corneal irritation was shown at 5 ppm, and irritation of the nasal cavities (ulcerative rhinitis) and breathlessness were observed at 10 ppm (90-day conversion: 0.015mg/L). Furthermore, at 25 ppm (90-day conversion: 0.037mg/L), severe respiratory distress were observed. Thereafter, the animals exhibited drastic loss of body weight and died of respiratory failure.(SIDS (accessed in July 2008)). These studies indicated that exposure to the substance affects the respiratory system and eyes. Doses that induced symptoms were 10-25 ppm (90-day conversion: 0.015-0.037mg/L), which are equivalent to Category 1 guidance values. Thus, the substance was classified into Category 1 (respiratory system). 97-day oral exposure tests using dogs and 100-day oral exposure tests using rats both yielded negative results (SIDS (accessed in July 2008)).</rationale>
