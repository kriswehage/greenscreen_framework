    <rationale>In a study with female rats which were administered orally from day 0 of gestation until day 21 of rearing, it is reported that "at doses at which lower body weights, increases in liver and adrenal gland weights and centrilobular swelling of hepatocytes were observed in parent animals, prolonged gestation periods and a decrease in the number of births were observed. The following effects on offspring were also observed at the same doses: lower body weight and defects in the kidneys and ureter in males and females; lower kidney, testis, seminal vesicle, epididymis, prostate and anus-bulbocavernosus muscle weights, defects in seminal vesicles, epididymal hypoplasia/agenesis, small testes, loss of germ cells in testes, Leydig cell hyperplasia and loss of sperm in ducts of the epididymis in males; uterine hypoplasia/agenesis, ovarian and oviductal agenesis and mineral deposition at the kidney-corticomedullary junction in females" (CERI/NITE Hazard Assessment Report (2008)). Therefore, because effects were observed in the second generation at doses at which minor effects are observed in parent animals, it was classified as Category 1B. Also, in a two-generation reproductive toxicity study in male and female rats, it is reported that "in F0 and F1 male and female parent animals in the groups with 1,200 ppm or greater, decreased weight gain and feed intake and diffuse hypertrophy of hepatocytes and thyroid follicular epithelial cells were observed, and as effects on offspring, decreases in anogenital distances (AGD) and development of areola mammae were observed in the F1male offspring in the 6,000 ppm group and in the F2 male offspring in the groups with 1,200 ppm or greater" and "a decrease in the number of sperm, but no changes in mating fertility and fertility were observed in the F1 male parent animals" (CERI/NITE Hazard Assessment Report (2008), MOE Risk Assessment, vol. 3 (2004). </rationale>

    <rationale>In the two-generation reproduction toxicity study of dietary administration in male and female rats, "diffuse hypertrophy of hepatocytes in liver and follicular epithelial cell hypertrophy of the thyroid were observed in parent animals (F0)" (CERI/NITE Hazard Assessment Report (2008), MOE Risk Assessment vol 3 (2004)), and the primary document (Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (2003) Report on two-generation reproduction toxicity study of Dicyclohexyl phthalate) shows that "changes in the liver are considered to be caused by adaptive response induced by drug-metabolizing enzyme. And follicular epithelial cell hypertrophy of the thyroid is considered to be caused by the changes associated with hypertrophy of hepatocytes." Moreover, in the 90-day oral administration test, although it is not within the limits of the guidance value of Category 2, "histological changes in the liver and kidney were observed" (CERI/NITE Hazard Assessment Report (2008), MOE Risk Assessment vol 3 (2004)). Therefore, since some effects of the substance to liver are observed but considered to be caused by adaptive response, classification is not possible.    </rationale>
