In addition, in oral administration tests conducted during the organogenetic period using rats (dose: 25-225 mg/kg/d), administration had no effects on any inspection items related to reproductive toxicity, and it was found to be non-teratogenic (A pesticide abstract and evaluation report (Food and Agricultural Materials Inspection Center) (2008)). Also, in oral administration tests conducted during the organogenetic period using rabbits (dose: 5-30 mg/kg/d), administration had no effects on any inspection items related to implantation and fetuses, and it was found to be non-teratogenic (A pesticide abstract and evaluation report (Food and Agricultural Materials Inspection Center) (2008)). These results indicate that the substance is to be classified into the "Not classified" category; however, since they were obtained using List 2 datasets, the substance was classified into "Classification not possible".

In 4-week repeated dermal exposure tests using rabbits, administration of 400-1000 mg/kg/d (90-day conversion: 107-270 mg/kg/d) showed no effects other than vacuolization of hepatocyte cytoplasm and an increased GPT (A pesticide abstract and evaluation report (Food and Agricultural Materials Inspection Center) (2008)). On the other hand, motor ataxia in male rats and decreased activities were reported in the above-mentioned rat tests; moderate to extensive, reversible vacuolization was detected in the cerebral cortex and optic nerves in 90-day repeated oral administration tests using mice (A pesticide abstract and evaluation report (Food and Agricultural Materials Inspection Center) (2008)); and similar reversible neuropathy was observed in mice that received administration for 52 weeks (A pesticide abstract and evaluation report (Food and Agricultural Materials Inspection Center) (2008)).
