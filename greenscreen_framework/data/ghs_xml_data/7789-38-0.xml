Reduction in sperm concentrations was found with male F0 parent animals and reduction in sperm concentrations was also found with male F1 child animals, although there is no statistical significance, "and " Although no toxicity relating to female rats' reproduction was observed, reduction in sperm concentrations of dose dependence nature was observed with male rats in the reproductive toxicity screening study via drinking water administratin using male and female rats.

    <rationale>As for toxic symptoms of Bromate Anemia, there is a description that "hemolysis, kidney trouble, and hardness of hearing" were seen in humans who did oral ingestion of the solution containing this article (EHC 216 (2000), IRIS (2001)), and another description that "Vomiting, a stomachache, and diarrhea were seen as irritant effect on the gastrointestinal effect and a lethargy low blood pressures, hypotonia (hypotonicity), and reflexes absents were seen as central nervous system effect" (IRIS (2001)). Moreover, the paragraph of a GHS classification of ICSC (2006) has a statement that "kidney and a nervous system are impaired when oral ingestion is carried out," and the paragraph of short-term exposure influence has a description that "Airway will be stimulated. Kidney and nervous systems may be affected and kidney failures, respiratory dysfunction, deafness and peripheral neuropathy may be produced when oral ingestion is carried out."

    <rationale>In the dermal administration test for 26 weeks and 39 weeks using male and female mice, "follicular cell hypertrophy was observed in thyroid" (NTP DB (Access on December 2008)). Moreover, in the 27-week and 43-week study of administration in drinking water to male and female mice, "on thyroid findings, follicular cell hypertrophy, depleted follicular secretion and an increase in lymphocytic infiltrate were seen, and about the kidney results, kidney syndrome and kidney tubule hypertrophy were observed" (NTP DB (Access on December 2008)). Since these effects were observed within the limits of the guidance value of Category 2, it was classified into Category 2 (thyroid, kidney). In the multi-generation reproduction toxicity study of administration in drinking water to male and female rats (NTP (2001), Unaudited Draft Final Report), "proliferation of kidney cells was observed in female rats, and chronic nephropathy and hyaline droplet accumulation were observed in male rats" (NTP DB (Access on December 2008)), but hyaline droplet is considered to be a symptom peculiar to male rats because there is the description that it is "a symptom caused by excessive accumulation of alpha2u globulin to kidney tubule" (IARC 73 (1999), NTP DB (Access on December 2008)). Moreover, in the reproductive toxicity screening study using male and female rats, "although a dose-dependent decrease in sperm concentration was observed in male rats, any effects associated with the dose were not observed in the histopathological examination of liver, kidney, lien, testis and epididymis" (NTP DB (Access on December 2008)). </rationale>
