The strongest signs of irritation were observed in all 3 animals within the first 24 hours. By day 8 only one animal showed slight corneal opacity and conjunctival redness (SIDS (accessed in September 2008)). Therefore, the substance was classified into "Not classified".</rationale>

    <rationale>In a micronucleus test with oral administration using mice and Chinese hamsters (in vivo mutagenicity test using somatic cells), only the highest dose (in the range of the LD50) caused an induction of micronuclei (SIDS (accessed in September 2008)). The substance was negative in another micronucleus test using mice and Chinese hamsters, a chromasomal aberration test using human lymphocytes and rat blood cells (somatic cell in vivo mutagenicity test), a chromasomal aberration test using mouse testis cells and oocytes (SIDS (accessed in September 2008)). Furthermore, in a rat dominant lethal test (in vivo multi-generation mutagenicity test), preimplantation loss or depression of female fertility attributable to the test substance was observed, and the study was negative (SIDS (accessed in September 2008)). Therefore, the substance was classified into "Not classified". As relevant information, in in-vivo genotoxicity tests, it is reported that a single oral dose did not induce unscheduled DNA synthesis in pancreatic cells from rats, and in sister chromatid exchange tests using mice and Chinese hamsters, no increase in SCE was seen (SIDS (accessed in September 2008)). In in vitro mutagenicity tests, it is reported that the substance was negative in an Ames test and in mouse and human lymphocyte tests, but was positive in a chromosomal aberration test using hamsters in the absence of metabolic activation (SIDS (accessed in September 2008)).</rationale>

    <rationale>In 78 week and 104 week oral administration tests using rats, there were no differences between control and treated animals for tumor incidences (SIDS (accessed in September 2008)). In a series of experiments, female mice orally received the substance for 43 weeks. Neither the incidence of mammary carcinomas nor mean time to tumor appearance were significantly affected; however, the number of mammary adenocarcinomas had significantly increased among those given 500 mg/L (HSDB (2006)). Furthermore, the substance is rated Group 3 in IARC. Therefore, the substance was classified into "Not classified".</rationale>

    <rationale>In a reproductive test using rats that underwent oral administration, no significant difference in birth rate, birth number, survival rate, or sex ratio of the offspring was noted, but the motility and velocity of sperm were slightly decreased and average radius was decreased in parental animals (SIDS (accessed in September 2008)). In addition, in a mouse reproductive test with oral administration, there were significant differences between control and treated animals for offspring birth number, survival rate, and body weight reduction. Therefore, slight reproductive toxicity was suggested. While, in a developmental toxicity test with oral administration to rats and mice during the organogenetic period, no developmental toxicity was observed (SIDS (accessed in September 2008)). In humans, there are many epidemiological reports on reduced body weights of neonates, abortion and stillbirth, delayed conception, and reduced fertility (Birth Defects (3rd, 2000)). And in a mouse reproductive test, there were significant differences between control and treated animals for offspring birth number and survival rate. Accordingly, its reproductive toxicity in humans was considered, and the substance was classified into Category 1A.</rationale>

With one exception (dose-dependent cellular enlargement in salivary gland), no pronounced significant changes were observed (SIDS (accessed in September 2008)). In addition, the NOAEL = 151 mg/kg/day (SIDS (accessed in September 2008)), which is above the guidance value of Category 2. Accordingly, the substance should be classified in "Not classified" (oral). However, since there is no information available on other routes, the substance was classified into "Classification not possible".</rationale>
