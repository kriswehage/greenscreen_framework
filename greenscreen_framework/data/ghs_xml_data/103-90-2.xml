As mentioned above, although there was data of two or more body cell in vivo mutagenicity tests, since there was no positive data of a productive cell in vivo genotoxicity test, it was classified into Category 2. In addition, there are descriptions of "negative" (IARC 73 (1999) (IUCLID (2000)) in the reverse mutation test employing Salmonella typhimurium as an in vitro mutagenicity test and "negative" (IUCLID (2000)) in the reverse mutation test employing coli bacteria. </rationale>

On the other hand, since there is also a description as follows, "The number of cleft palates, skeletal deformation and development of hydronephrosis increased depending on dose levels" (IUCLID (2000)) in the oral administration study with female mice during 6-15 days of pregnancy, classification is not possible. </rationale>

    <rationale>IARC73 (1999) and NTP TR394 (1993) have a report that "hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity were foreseen" in the oral administration test which used multiple human cases and animals (rats, mice, dogs). Moreover, HSDB (2007) has descriptions that "confusion, a temperature fall, inactivity, shallow respiration, arrhythmia, a blood-pressure fall, and inadequate circulations may occur followed by excitement and mental confusions, " as a symptoms, that "symptom advances in four steps: The 1st step - loss of appetite, nausea, vomit, sense of discomfort, diaphoresis, the 2nd step - an abdominal pain, tenderness, enlarged liver, a bilirubin elevation, increasing liver enzymes concentrations, prolonged prothrombin time, oliguria depending on the case, the 3rd step - loss of appetite, nausea, vomit, the recurrence of sense of discomfort, liver failures, kidney failures, cardiomyopathy, and the 4th step - recovery or liver failures that results fatality", and that "excessive dosage may cause the increase of gastrointestinal ulcers and bleeding risk by epidemiological study". In animal studies, on the other hand, there is a description that "the necrosis was looked at by the bronchial epithelium and the testis in addition to the effect on liver and kidney" in the oral administration test employing a mouse (IARC 73 (1999)), and such symptoms were foreseen within the limits of the guidance value of Category 2. As mentioned above, it was classified into Category 1 (liver, the kidney, a central nervous system, the heart, digestive system) and Category 2 (the respiratory system, testis). In addition, HSDB (2007) has a warning reporting that "skin reactions including the spots-like papular eruption accompanied by pruritus and hives occurs" by dosing it, and a description that "the reaction pharynx part dropsy, blood vessel nature dropsy, and like an anaphylaxis may occur rarely." as a sensitivity reaction. </rationale>

    <rationale> For humans, there is a report that "chronic active hepatitis accompanies chronic ingestion and chronic kidney disease accompanies prolonged use" (NTP TR394 (1993)). There are also reports from human epidemiological studies that "toxicity was shown" (IARC 73 (1999)), "an increase in kidney lipofuscinosis, chronic kidney disease and hemolytic anemia through excessive long-term ingestion were observed" (Patty (5th, 2001)) and "neutropenic and thrombocytopenic disorders were observed" (HSDB (2007)). Therefore the liver, kidney and blood system are considered to be target organs. Furthermore, in a 2-year oral administration study in rats and mice (21 CFR Part 58, GLP) there is a report that "increased severity of nephropathy in male and female rats, increased frequency of localized kidney tubule hyperplasia and kidney hyperparathyroidism in male rats, and increased thyroid follicular epithelial hyperplasia in male and female mice were observed" (NTP TR394 (1993)), and these effects are seen to be within the range of guidance values for Category 2. For the reasons stated above, we classified it as Category 1 (liver, kidney and blood system) and Category 2 (thyroid). As for observed effects which are outside the range of guidance values for Category 2, there is a report that "at 12,500 ppm (corresponding value: 625 mg/kg) testis atrophy and at 25,000 ppm (corresponding value: 1,250 mg/kg) ovarian and uterine atrophy were observed" in a 13-week oral administration study in rats (NTP TR 394 (1993)). </rationale>
