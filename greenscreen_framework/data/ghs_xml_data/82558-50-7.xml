In addition, micronucleus tests using male mice (dose: 0 or 5000 mg/kg) gave positive results (HSDB (2006)) while other micronucleus tests using male mice resulted in unclear outcome (IRIS (1993)). Overall, several in vivo mutagenicity tests using somatic cells gave positive results, although few tests gave negative results; so we classified the substance into Category 2. As additional information, in vivo genotoxicity tests (Ames tests and chromosomal aberration tests using CHO cells) gave negative results (IRIS (1993), HSDB (2006)).</rationale>

In different rat tests (dose: 300 and 1000 mg/kg/day), an increase in preimplantation loss and resorptions was detected at the doses that suppress doby weight gain in parental animals (IRIS (1993)). In teratogenicity tests using rabbits (dose: 0-1000 mg/kg/day), 1 case of miscarriage and 5 cases of death were detected in 1000 mg/kg groups (Pesticide Safety Information (Japan Crop Protection Association) No.18 (1995)). Similarly, in mixed diet administration tests using rats (dose: 0, 40, 200, and 1000 mg/kg/day), exencephaly and microphthalmia were identified in offspring (HSDB (2006)). From these results, the substance was classified into Category 2 for detecting reproductive toxicity at doses that cause general toxicity in parental animals. As additional information, teratogenicity tests using rats (dose: 0-1000 mg/kg/day) found neither general nor reproductive toxicity, drawing a conclusion that the substance is in "Not classified" category (Pesticide Safety Information (Japan Crop Protection Association) No.18 (1995)).</rationale>

These results and the description from the evaluation of this substance that "its acute toxicity is weak and is equivalent to normal substances" (Pesticide Safety Information (Japan Crop Protection Association) No.18 (1995): The Institute of Environmental Toxicology) indicate that the substance is to be placed in "Not classified" category (oral route).

In different mixed diet tests using rats, LEL value was 1250 ppm (90-day correction: 250 mg/kg/day) (IRIS (1993)). In 90-day mixed diet tests using dogs, LEL value was 500 mg/kg/day (IRIS (1993)). In 3-month mixed diet tests using dogs (dose: 0-500 mg/kg/day), no toxic symptoms caused by the substance were discovered (Pesticide Safety Information (Japan Crop Protection Association) No.18 (1995)). These results indicate the placement of the substance in the "Not classified" category (oral route). However, due to lack of information on other administration routes, the substance was classified into "Classification not possible". As additional information, in 3-month mixed diet administration tests using rats (dose: 0-12500 ppm), hepatocyte hypertrophy was detected at the dose (12500 ppm; conversion value: 625 mg/kg) which is not in the range of guidance values, and the results were not included as grounds for classification.</rationale>
