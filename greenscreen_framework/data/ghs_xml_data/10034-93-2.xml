    <rationale>No test results are available on salts of hydrazine. However, hydrazine (CAS: 302-01-2) has been classified into Category 1 for the reasons that it is known to induce allergic contact dermatitis (EHC 68, 1987) and classified as a skin sensitizing substance by Japan society for Occupational Health (Recommendations of Occupational Exposure Limits (2007)). Thus, we determined that hydrazine sulfate falls under Category 1 as well.</rationale>

According to reports on hydrazine (CAS: 302-01-2), a heritable mutagenicity test (dominant lethal test) gave negative results, no in vivo germ cell mutagenicity test was conducted, an an in vivo mutagenicity test using somatic cell (micronucleus test using mouse erythrocytes) gave positive results, and no in vivo genotoxicity test was conducted (Hazard Assessment Report (NITE, CERI), No.73 (2004); EHC 68, 1987).

    <rationale>In a hypodermal administration test in which pregnant rats were treated with hydrazine sulfate from day 11 to day 20 of gestation, the exposed dams showed a 20% decrease in body weight and 2 dams died. Reduced number of viable fetuses were found while no effects on numbers of implantation were noted by a Caesarean section performed on 9 dams on day 21 of gestation. The fetuses had reduced body weights and appeared pale and oedematous (neither body parts nor number of fetuses with these signs were given, presumably systemic in nature), but did not exhibit any major malformations. Based on this report, the substance was classified into Category 2. As additional background information, in a developmental toxicity test in which mice were treated with hydrazine (CAS: 302-01-2), excencephaly was seen in fetuses at doses that induced general toxicity. Thus, hydrazine is classified into Category 2.</rationale>

    <rationale>Classification of hydrazine salts is not possible due to insufficient test results available. With regard to the effects of hydrazine (CAS: 302-01-2), the following symptoms are reported in humans: confusion, lethargy, restlessness, unconsciousness, flushing, sporadic violent behavior and later developed ataxia, lateral nystagmus, decreased sense of vibration, paraesthesia in the arms and legs, elevated levels of AST, LDH, and total bilirubin (EHC 68 (1987)), and greatly elevated enzymatic values related to hepatic toxicity (Hazard Assessment Report (CERI, NITE) No. 73, 2003). These symptoms indicated that the nervous system and the liver are target organs. In addition, since lethargy was seen (EHC 68 (1987)), the substance presumably has narcotic effects and is classified into Category 3. Thus, this substance was classified into Category 1 for the nervous system and liver, and Category 3 for narcotic effects.</rationale>

    <hazard_statement>Cause damage to organs through prolonged or repeated exposure (nervous system, liver, respiratory system, kidney, adrenal gland)</hazard_statement>
    <rationale>In humans who ingested hydrazine sulfate three times a day for 1 to 6 months, vomiting, dizziness, excitation, insomnia, and polyneuritis syndrome were observed (ATSDR, 1997). In tests in which hamsters underwent forced oral administration for 15 to 20 weeks, cirrhosis, reticuloendothelial cell hyperplasia, and bile-duct proliferation were observed (Hazard Assessment Report (CERI, NITE), 2004). These reports indicated that the nervous system and liver are target organs. The effects seen in test animals were associated with doses that fall under the range of Category 1 guidance values.
Regarding the effect of hydrazine (CAS: 302-01-2) on humans, the following were observed: jaundice, pneumonia, elevated creatinine levels, urine proteins, and bloody urine, focal hepatocellular necrosis, severe nephritis, necrosis of renal tubules, glomerulonephritis (Hazard Assessment Report (CERI, NITE), No. 73, 2003), pleural effusion and lung shadowing shown in X-ray examinations, elevated bilirubin levels in the blood, and pneumonia and hepatocellular damage revealed by autopsy (EHC 68, 1987). In treated animals, the following changes were observed: proliferation of the liver and bile-duct, degeneration of the adrenal gland, inflammation of the nasal mucosa, and necrosis, scaling, hyperplasia, and squamous cell metaplasia of the nasal epithelium (Hazard Assessment Report (CERI, NITE), No. 73, 2003). Based on these reports, we think hydrazine's target organs are the liver, respiratory system, kidney, and adrenal gland. All the effects seen in test animals were associated with doses that fall under the range of Category 1 guidance values. Based on the information above, this substance was classified into Category 1 (nervous system, liver, respiratory system, kidney, and adrenal gland).
