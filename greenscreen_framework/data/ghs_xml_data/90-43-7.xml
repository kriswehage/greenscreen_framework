As relevant notes, a positive reaction was observed in 7 out of 588 persons to whom a 1% solution of this substance in petrolatum was applied. However, the severity of the reaction was not described in the literature. In addition, two cases of severe contact dermatitis through occupational exposure were described in the literature, which the author put down to the effects of this substance in hand cream and in metal-working fluids (DFGOT (1991)).</rationale>

    <rationale>Based on Group 3 classification by IARC, the substance was classified into "Not classified".
As relevant information, in the studies in which rats and mice were fed a diet containing the substance for 2 years, structural alterations in the kidney and urinary bladder, including urothelial hyperplasia and neoplasia (papilloma and transitional cell carcinoma), were observed in rats; and increased incidence of liver adenomas cases were observed in mice. However, these incidences of neoplasms were seen only in males given mid-doses or higher (PATTY 5th, (2001)).</rationale>

    <rationale>In the 2-generation reproduction tests using rats, there were no effects on reproduction or development at the doses that cause general toxicity such as decreased body weight gain in parental animals and histological changes in the kidney and urinary bladder (PATTY 5th, (2001)). In other studies involving rats, rabbits and mice that were exposed during the organogenetic period, the substance had no adverse effects such as teratogenic effects in the offspring, although in parental animals, decreased body weight gain, mortality, and pathological changes in the kidney and liver were observed at high dosages in all species tested (IARC (1999) vol. 73, PATTY 5th, (2001), CERI hazard data 5th (2007)). From these results, the substance was classified into "Not classified". As additional notes, increased incidences of embryo resorption by exposure to this substance during the organogenetic period were documented. However, since this symptom was observed only in one of two rat studies conducted, the result may be accidental.</rationale>

    <rationale>In 3-month oral exposure studies using rats, pathological changes were observed in the kidney at 1000-1500mg/kg/day. However, in other rat oral exposure studies of 3-month and 6-month durations, no pathological changes were observed at 500-1000mg/kg/day (DFGOT (1991)). In two other rat studies performing 12 or 13-week oral route exposure, NOAEL were reported to be &gt;= 420mg/kg/day and &gt;= 780mg/kg/day (PATTY 5th (2001)). On the other hand, in 2-year oral route exposure studies with mice, decreased body weight gain and histological changes in livers were observed at &gt;= 250mg/kg/day, and NOEL was indicated to be 100mg/kg/day (PATTY 5th (2001)). There are no studies on humans, and toxicity to organs observed in animal tests was associated only with administration doses higher than the guidance values. Although these results suggested that the substance falls into "Not classified" (oral), there were no data on other routes available. Thus, the substance was classified into "Classification not possible".</rationale>
