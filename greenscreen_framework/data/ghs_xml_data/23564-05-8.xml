Based on these reports, the substance was classified into "Not classified".

    <rationale>Two-year mixed diet administration tests using ICR mice found that the substance has no carcinogenic effects (EHC No. 64 (1986)). In addition, in 18-month mixed diet administration tests using CD1 mice, an increase in tumors was not observed in treated mice compared with historical data on control groups (JMPR (1977)). Furthermore, in the tests using SD rats that were administered for 2 years, no signs of substance's effects were found other than suppressed growth (EHC No. 64 (1986)). In contrast, in 2-year mixed diet administration tests using Fischer rats, incidences of thyroid follicular-cell adenoma (developed in 12 of 60 treated rats) increased at the highest dose tested (6000 ppm). Thyroid follicular-cell adenocarcinomas were detected in 1 of 2 males in the highest dose group who survived to the end of the experiment, and 2 of 53 treated males that died or were killed during the experiment (JMPR (1977)). Overall, because thyroid follicular cell adenocarcinoma were detected in the tests involving Fischer rats only, the adenocarcinoma incidences occurred at a low rate, and adenocarcinoma was associated with males only, the substance was classified into "Not classified".</rationale>

    <rationale>In 2-generation tests using rats, neither dose-dependent abnormalities nor reproductive toxicity were found in F1a, F2a or F2b in the functional examinations, although abnormalities were detected in the thyroid gland or liver in F0 and F1 animal groups that were treated with the highest dose. In 3-generation tests using rats, dose-dependent effects on mating, gestation period or pregnancy rate were not detected in dissected F0, F1b and F2b, and no dose-dependent effects on the external appearance, weight of the organs, pathology low index or a skeleton in offspring of F3b. In the tests using pregnant rats or mice that underwent oral administration during the organogenetic period, no dose-dependent effects were detected on the number of implantation, post-implantation loss, weight of fetuses, sex ratio, number of surviving fetuses, fetal malformation or abnormal development (JMPR (1977)). In the tests using pregnant rabbits that underwent oral administration during the organogenetic period, no effects of administration were detected except for numerical abnormality of ribs and skeletal deformity such as incomplete and asymmetrical ossification of the pelvis or vertebra (JMPR (1977)). Since no signs of reproductive toxicity were detected in the heritable tests using rats, and no signs of developmental toxicity were found in rats, mice or rabbits, the substance was classified into "Not classified".</rationale>

    <rationale>In dogs that underwent oral administration (capsules) for 24 months, no abnormalities were observed in pathological examinations other than an increased weight of the thyroid gland was observed at doses of 50 and 250 mg/kg (EHC No. 64 (1986)). In 6-month mixed diet administration tests using mice, abnormalities were detected in the liver in animal groups that received a dose (240 mg/kg/day) much higher than Category 2 guidance doses. In 6-month mixed diet administration tests using rats, abnormalities were detected in the thyroid gland at the dose (400 mg/kg/day) that exceeded Category 2 guidance doses. In 3-month oral administration (capsules) tests using dogs, follicular-cell hypertrophy in the thyroid was observed in animal groups for all doses including 50 mg/kg/day. It is also documented that 1-year oral administration (capsules) tests using dogs, follicular-cell hypertrophy in the thyroid was observed at 40 mg/kg/day in pathological examinations (JMPR (1977)). Since follicular-cell hypertrophy in the thyroid was observed in 3-month and 1-year dog tests at the doses that fall under Category 2 guidance values, the substance was classified into Category 2 (thyroid gland).</rationale>
