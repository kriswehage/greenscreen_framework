    <rationale>It is documented that administration of lidocaine in humans caused methemoglobinemia, and since 2,6-dimethylaniline is a metabolite of lidocaine, 2,6-dimethylaniline is considered to have caused methemoglobinemia (IARC vol. 57 (1993)). Also, it is reported that exposure at high levels may result in the formation of methaemoglobin (ICSC (2007)). Therefore, the substance was classified into Category 1 (blood). As relevant information, in an oral administration test by gavage using rats, at the dose of 300 mg/kg, slight hypolocomotion with ptosis was observed, but it was reversible from three hours after administration. At the dose of 2000 mg/kg, immediately after administration, severe hypolocomotion, lateral position, abnormal gait, flaccidity, and slightly deep respiration were observed, and treated animals died within 24 hours after administration. In the urinary bladders of dead animals, reddish urine was seen, and it was considered to be hematotoxicity on the kidneys or by hemolysis (Toxicity Testing Reports of Environmental Chemicals (Chemicals Investigation Promoting Council) (accessed in September 2008)). Also, it is reported that in an oral administration test by gavage using rats, groups administered 620 mg/kg or more had reddened renal papillae (NTP TR278 (1990)), and in another oral administration test by gavage using rats, mottling of the kidney was the most notable lesion seen in survivors (NTP TR278 (1990)). They suggested effects on the kidney. However, since both lacked distinct pathological descriptions, and due to a lack of data, the substance was classified into "Classification not possible".</rationale>

In addition, in an oral administration test by gavage using rats for 13 weeks (dose, 20, 40, 80, 160, and 310 mg/kg), at the dose of 40 mg/kg, which is equivalent to the guidance value of Category 2 or more, reduced body weight gain, increased relative weights of the brain and the kidneys, reduced leukocyte count, at doses of 80 mg/kg or more, reduced lymphocyte count and increased segmented neutrophil count were observed, and at the dose of 160 mg/kg, which is equivalent to the guidance value of "Not classified", reduced hemoglobin level, and at the dose of 310 mg/kg, reduced hematocrit level were observed (IUCLID (2000)). Furthermore, in an oral administration test by gavage using mice for 13 weeks (dose, 20, 40, 80, 160, and 310 mg/kg), at the dose of 310 mg/kg above the guidance value of Category 2, reduced body weight, increased weight of liver in males, changes in nasal cavity were noted, and in females, at the dose of 20 mg/kg equivalent to the guidance value of Category 2, changes in leukocytes were observed (IUCLID (2000)).
