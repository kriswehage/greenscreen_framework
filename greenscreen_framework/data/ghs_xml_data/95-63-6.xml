    <rationale>For humans, it is reported that "in a survey of workers using a solvent containing Trimethylbenzene isomers adulterated with Benzene, symptoms of the central nervous system, symptoms of the central nervous system, asthmatoid bronchitis and anemia can be seen, but for anemia the effects of Benzene cannot be ignored" (ACGIH (7th, 2001), (MOE Risk Assessment, vol. 6 (2008)). However, this solvent was a mixture containing 50% of the substance under consideration and 30% of isomers 1, 3, and 5, so this report was not used. For animals, there are reports that "reversible tubular hyaline droplet degeneration were observed in the kidney in males, but no effects in females" (Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare Report (Access on September 2008)) in a 28-day repeated oral toxicity test in rats (Guidelines for the 28-Day Repeat Dose Toxicity Test of Chemicals (Japan), GLP), and that "irreversible impairment in motor coordination, significantly increased incidence of lung damage and reduction of erythrocyte count" (MOE Risk Assessment, vol. 6 (2008)) were observed in a 3-month inhalation exposure test in male rats. Effects on laboratory animals seen in the central nervous system, lungs and blood system are all within the range of guidance values for Category 2, but there are no other findings on the blood system, so these reports are not used. The kidney symptoms are considered to be effects specific for male rats, and are outside the range of guidance values for Category 2. For the reasons stated above, it was classified as Category 2 (central nervous system, lungs). </rationale>
