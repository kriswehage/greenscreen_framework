    <rationale>Its rat LC50 value (4-8h) is documented to be &gt; 0.38 mg/L (&gt; 66 ppm) (EHC 20, 1982). Its saturated vapour pressure concentration is approximately 69 to 1579 ppm (calculated based on its vapour pressure of 0.07-1.6 hPa at 20degC (IUCLID, 2000)). Since the LC50 value is less than 90% of the saturated vapour pressure concentration, it is assumed that the test was carried out in a vapour state with almost no included mists, and categorization was conducted using ppmV concentration criteria. As a result, we were unable to categorize the substance with its LC50 value (4-8h) of &gt; 0.38 mg/L (&gt; 66 ppm). Thus, it was classified into "Classification not possible".</rationale>

    <rationale>Its documented rat LC50 values (4h) are &gt; 2450 ppm, &gt; 580 ppm, and &gt; 553 ppm. Its saturated vapour pressure concentration is approximately 69 to 1579 ppm (calculated based on its vapour pressure of 0.07-1.6 hPa at 20degC (IUCLID, 2000)). Among these LC 50 values acquired, only the value of &gt; 2450 ppm was classified assuming that it was acquired under a mist state. However, because its molecular weight could not be specified, the unit of the LC50 could not be converted from ppm to mg/L; thus, the substance was classified into the "Classification not possible" category.
Similarly, in other studies, molecular weight of the test substance cannot be determined, disenabling the comparison of the molecular weight with the saturated vapour pressure concentration. Consequently, we cannot determine if the experiment was conducted in a vapor or mist state, and thus, classification is not possible.</rationale>

    <rationale>In two human studies (GLP-compliant), in which 26 people were applied with this substance on the upper-arm skin under sealed conditions for 2.5 days, the substance was found to be not irritating (IUCLID, 2000). However, it is documented in a clinical study that the more aromatic solvents, in particular, can cause a significant degree of primary skin irritation (EHC 20, 1982). Seven rabbit tests documented include three tests by EHC 20 (1982); one of them found the substance moderately irritating with Draize score of 2.79 (equivalent to Category 2), while two other tests also found the substance moderately irritating with Draize scores of 2.04 and 2.17 (both scores are equivalent to "Not classified" category. They are also equivalent to Category 3 in the United Nations classification). In addition, four tests (GLP-compliant) by the IUCLID (2000) found that the substance is moderately irritating in two tests, and slightly irritating in two other tests. Based on these results, the substance was classified into Category 2 for conservative estimate.</rationale>

Despite these results, the IARC documented that the study was of insufficient duration to allow an evaluation of carcinogenicity, and petroleum solvents as a whole is classified into Group 3 (equivalent to "Not classified" category) (IARC 47, 1989).

In addition, in 13-week inhalation exposure tests using rats, notable functional disorder of the organs was not detected other than an increase in organ weight (liver and kidney) and low-grade anemia at the doses (1.8, 3.7, and 7.4 mg/L) that are above the upper limit of guidance values (IARC 47, 1989). Based on these results, the substance was classified into "Not classified" for inhalation route. In 13-week oral administration tests using rats, effects of the administration on the liver, stomach, thyroid gland or bladder were detected (IUCLID, 2000). However, since the tests were conducted using doses (300, 600, and 1000 mg/kg bw /day) that were above the upper limit of guidance values, classification was not possible. As relevant notes, Patty 5th (2001) reported, with regard to the signs of chronic toxicity, that depending on the amount of benzene content, depression of the central nervous system and mild to severe changes in the hematopoietic system may occur.</rationale>
