Moreover, the EPA report which described this evalutation (U.

When we reviewed "A review of the environmental impact and toxic effects of TCMTB (1991))", one of the references for the 52-day feeding study in dogs, it states that there is "no significant effects," and there are no reports of leukopenia and monocytopenia.
