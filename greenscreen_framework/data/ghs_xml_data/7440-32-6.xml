    <rationale>In evaluation of the biocompatibility of pure titanium and two different titanium alloys, titanium alloys were implanted into the dorsal subcutaneous tissues of a guinea pig for 12 weeks and were immersed in calf serum or in Ringer's solution for 8 weeks&#8212;no evident surface changes were found (HSDB (2003)). In addition, both mutation assays (of Salmonella typhimurium TA98, S. typhimurium TA 100, and Escherichia coli WP2 uvrA) and unscheduled DNA synthesis tests, using the solutions in which the test substances were immersed, gave negative results (HSDB (2003)). Although these tests did not find mutagenic effects of titanium, due to lack of other appropriate test results, classification is not possible.
According to the classification of titanium dioxide by the Japanese Government, both mouse micronucleus tests and mouse chromosomal aberration tests gave negative results (NTP DB, 2005) and thus titanium dioxide was classified into the "Not classified" category.</rationale>

    <rationale>No evaluations have been carried out on carcinogenic effects of titanium by any assessment agencies. Thus, it is not classifiable.
Regarding titanium dioxide, it is rated as "Group 3" by the IARC and "A4" by ACGIH, with both ratings indicating that titanium dioxide is not classifiable as to its carcinogenicity to humans (IARC V47, 1989; ACGIH-TLV, 2005). According to the classification by the Japanese Government, titanium dioxide is classified into the "Not classified" category.
Titanium powder (at least 200 mesh) injected intramuscularly in 6, monthly doses, each of which contained 6 mg in trioctanoin, induced 2 fibrosarcomas in 25 male and 25 female rats and lymphosarcomas in 3 male rats (EHC 24, 1982).
No signs of carcinogenic effects were found in the following two tests: lead titanate suspended in physiological saline intratracheally administered to guinea pigs once every 3 months six times; and a 5 mg Ti/L concentration of titanium potassium oxalate in drinking water administered to mice during the span of their life (EHC 24, 1982).
On the other hand, tianocene was shown to be carcinogenic, when suspended in trioctanoin and injected intramuscularly into rats once a month, to give a total administered dose of 200 mg (EHC 24, 1982). In addition to fibrosarcomas, hepatomas, and malignant lymphomas of the spleen were noted (EHC 24, 1982). Of 50 rats treated with titanium dioxide, only three rats developed a total of three fibrosarcomas (EHC 24, 1982).
On the basis of these results, titanium has generally been considered to belong to the group of metals of low carcinogenicity (EHC 24, 1982).</rationale>

According to the classification of titanium dioxide by the Japanese Government, pneumoconiotic changes, which were not associated with the changes in lung function, were revealed in X-ray examinations in few of the workers who had been occupationally exposed to titanium dioxide dust for more than 20 years (DFGOT vol. 2, 1991). Based on this report, titanium dioxide is classified as Category 1 (lung (inhalation)).
In acute and subacute administration tests, titanium dioxide did not show toxic effects on the lung (EHC 24 (1982). Similarly, the tests in which guinea-pigs, rabbits, cats, and a dog were fed a diet containing titanium dioxide for 390 days did not cause any adverse effects in the animals (EHC 24 (1982)). In addition, the administration of titanium potassium oxalate in drinking-water at a concentration of 5 mg Ti/L to mice during their life span did not have any effects.</rationale>
