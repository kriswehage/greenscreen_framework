    <rationale>According to the IARC, the substance is categorized into Group 3 (equivalent to "Not classified" category) in an overall evaluation of petroleum solvents (IARC vol. 47, 1989). The substance's EU Risk Phrase is Category 2; R45 (equivalent to Category 1B), but only when it contains 0.1% or more of benzene (EU-Annex 1, accessed in September 2008; GESTIS, accessed in September 2008). Based on the report that the substance contains hardly any benzene today (IARC vol. 47, 1989), it was classified into "Not classified" in accordance with the IARC's evaluation.
According to the case-control studies targeting at rubber manufacturing workers (6678 males) at five locations in the USA, exposure to this substance caused an increase in relative risk of prostatic cancer and lymphatic leukemia. However, the number of cases in each category is small, multiple exposures were evaluated independently of other exposures, and none of the associations is significant (IARC vol. 47, 1989). Regarding case-control studies conducted in Canada (IARC vol. 47, 1989), as the exposure material contained this substance as well as other substances, these studies were not taken into consideration for the classification of this substance.</rationale>

As symptoms of overexposure or inhalation exposure, CNS depression and irritation of respiratory tracts are reported (HSDB, 2005). As acute neurotoxic effects, anesthesia, euphoria, vertigo, and limb numbness are recorded (HSDB, 2005). In addition, there is a description that the accidental use of the substance as an anesthetic drug may cause reversible cerebral edema (Patty 5th, 2001). In animal studies, though animal species used were unknown, narcotic effects and irritation to respiratory tracts were detected in inhalation tests (EHC 20, 1982). Based on these results, the substance was classified into Category 3 (respiratory tract irritation and narcotic effects).</rationale>

    <rationale>It is documented that factory workers exposed to this substance, with its air concentration between 2.25 and 5.625 mg/L, showed polyneuropathy, and the workers complained of insomnia, irritability, and other non-specific CNS symptoms (EHC 20, 1982). In addition, under the working environment in which the workers underwent a long-term inhalation exposure of the substance due to insufficient ventilation, they developed polyneuropathy, which includes symptoms such as loss of appetite, muscle weakness, impairment of motor action, and paresthesia (Patty 5th, 2001). Furthermore, as chronic neurotoxic effects, motor poluneuropathy is listed (HSDB, 2005). In 24-week inhalation exposure tests using rats, though exact exposure concentrations are unknown, a slight decrease in functions of the peripheral nervous system was observed (IARC vol. 47, 1989). Based on these results, the substance was classified into Category 1 (nervous system).
In inhalation exposure tests using rats that lasted for 1 to 6 months, nerve-related effects (decrease in conduction-velocity, increase in refractory period, and decrease in excitability) were observed. However, because of the description that test methods were not sufficiently rigorous (EHC 20, 1982), this study was not taken into consideration for the classification of this substance.</rationale>
