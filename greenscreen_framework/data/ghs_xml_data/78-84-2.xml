In addition, it has been described that "moderate to severe irritation and burn in rabbits and erythema in one of six rabbits" (SIDS (2004)), "including irritation on the skin" (NTP TR472 (1999)), and "similar irritaion to other aldehydes" (Patty (5th, 2001)) were determined in the skin irritation test with rabbits.
