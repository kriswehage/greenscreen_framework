Similarly, the substance caused skin irritation and contact dermatitis in humans (DFGOT vol.10, 1998; PATTY 5th, 2001, vol.4). In rabbit Draize tests, slight erythema (Draize score = 0.5; equivalent to "Not classified") was observed, and in topical tests in which guinea pigs were treated with an aqueous solution containing the substance, slight erythema (shown in 2 out of 10 treated guinea pigs) was observed only at 50% solution (CICADs (J) No.35, 2001). However, application of the substance to the skin of rabbits for 5 to 15 minutes caused severe erythema. Taking the skin irritation potential to humans into account, the substance was classified into Category 2.</rationale>

In Draize tests on rabbits, corneal clouding, iritis, and conjunctivitis were observed, and these symptoms disappeared within 21 days (CICADs (J) No.35, 2001). Also, in another test using rabbits, corneal clouding, redness, and swelling were observed, and these symptoms continued after 8 days (DFGOT vol.10, 1998). Furthermore, in other rabbit tests, the substance was documented to cause moderate eye irritation (PATTY 5th vol.4, 2001; IUCLID, 2000).

In addition, in the tests using guinea pigs, sensitization was not observed 24 and 48 hours after the application (CICADs (J) No.35, 2001). Based on the final evaluation that the substance is not sensitizing to the skin of humans and animals (CICADs (J) No.35, 2001), it was classified into "Not classified".</rationale>

Although a significantly increased postimplantation loss was observed (relative to the control animals) in dominant lethal tests using mice at the concentration documented to cause toxic effects (CICADs (J) No.35, 2001), the results were disregarded as they could not be fully evaluated.</rationale>

    <rationale>In oral route tests using rats, the following effects were observed: decreased body weight of maternal animals, decreased survival rates and growth rates of the offspring, reduced sizes of testes and ovaries, malformation of organs and skeletons, and cryptorchism (CICADs (J) No.35, 2001). In addition, in the dermal route tests using rats, the following effects were observed: decreased body weight gain of maternal animals, increased resorption of embryos, skeletal abnormalities (lack of sternebra, fusion and split of ribs, supernumerary ribs, dysraphism of skull, failed ossification of vertebrae, fusion of cervical atlas and occipital bones, and reduction or incomplete hyoid bones). In contrast, in dermal route tests using rabbits, symptoms of maternal toxicity were not observed and only mild toxicity to fetuses (skeletal mutation: development of accessory ribs) was observed (CICADs (J) No.35, 2001). In rat inhalation tests, no effects of the substance were found on body weight of parental animals, weight of testes and ovaries, and fertility properties in 8 of 11 datasets. Neither affected were: numbers of surviving littermates, corpus luteum, implantation, dead fetuses, embryo absorption, littermates; malformation or mutation of fetuses (excluding light skeletal mutation). Yet, some data indicated that the substance caused loss of pre-implantation embryos and delayed ossification, and other data indicated that the substance had slight maternal toxicity and fetal toxicity (CICADs (J) No.35, 2001). Overall, the effects on the development of offspring were observed in both oral and dermal route exposure, and there is data indicating developmental toxicity through inhalation. Thus, the substance was classified into Category 2.</rationale>

After the exposure, polypnea and slight blood trace on perinasal hair were observed (CICADs (J) No.35, 2001; DFGOT vol.10, 1998). In addition, in 2-hour inhalation tests using mice, the substance was documented to cause irritation of the eyes and upper airways (DFGOT vol.10, 1998).

    <rationale>In 90-day oral route tests using rats (CICADs (J) No.35, 2001), the NOAEL were 169mg/kg bw (males) and 217mg/kg bw (females). In 28-day oral route tests (CICADs (J) No.35, 2001; DFGOT vol.10, 1998; PATTY 5th, 200, vol.4), the NOAEL documented were 514mg/kg bw (90-day conversion: approx. 160mg/kg bw), 429mg/kg bw (males) (90-day conversion: approx. 133mg/kg bw), 1548mg/kg bw (females) (90-day conversion: approx. 482mg/kg bw); all these values were equivalent to the "Not classified" guidance values. In 20-day oral route tests using rabbits (DFGOT vol.10, 1998), no effects were observed on organs. In 13-week inhalation tests using rats (aerosol or mist) (CICADs (J) No.35, 2001; DFGOT vol.10, 1998), the effects on testes and the blood were observed. However, the administration dose was 3mg/L, which was equivalent to the "Not classified" guidance values. Similarly, in 4-week inhalation tests (aerosol or mist) (CICADs (J) No.35, 2001; DFGOT vol.10, 1998; PATTY 5th, 200, vol.4), the administration dose (90-day conversion: approx. 0.3mg/L), was equivalent to the "Not classified" guidance values. On the other hand, in another 2-week inhalation test using rats (assuming that the substance was in vapour state based on the administration dose of 1.0mg/L) (CICADs (J) No.35, 2001), 90-day conversion value of approx. 0.16mg/L (equivalent to Category 1 guidance values) was associated with reduction and necrosis of the bone marrow cells and the spleen (lymphocytes), necrosis of the liver, multifocal purulent pneumonia, ulceration of glandular stomach, and increased weight of adrenal glands. Moreover, in 5-month inhalation tests (assuming that the substance was in vapour state based on the administration dose of 0.1-0.15mg/L) (DFGOT vol.10, 1998), changes in the lung and kidney were observed at the dose equivalent to the Category 1 guidance values. Thus, the substance was classified into Category 1 (bone marrow, spleen, liver, respiratory system, adrenal gland, and kidney) for inhalation route only.</rationale>
