    <rationale>In a rabbit test (OECD TG405 (GLP)), at 1-hour after application, swelling and conjunctival injection as well as secretion were observed in all 3 animals. At 24, 48 and 72-hour, conjunctivitis and diffuse corneal opacities were found and 1 animal showed iritis. At 7 days after the application, corneal erosion and vascularization were observed in all animals. The effects were not reversible until test end (14 days after treatment) (SIDS (2004)). Although the reversibility within 24 days was not clear, mean Draize scores at 24 to 72-hour were 1.1 for corneal opacity, 1.9 for conjunctivitis and 1.3 for conjunctival swelling (SIDS (2004)). Additionally, the undiluted compound produced transient mild irritation of a rabbit eye (SIDS (2004)). Based on these information, the substance was classified into Category 2A, not corresponding to a corrosive substance.</rationale>

    <rationale>Based on a result of a positive ratio 66.7% (6/9) in a modified guinea pig maximization test (SIDS (2004)), the substance was classified into Category 1. Although there are results of "not sensitizing" in another guinea pig maximization test and a human patch test (SIDS (2004)), a small number of animals or subjects were used in both tests, especially, in the human patch test. Therefore, it was reported that no final assessment could be drawn due to the small number of subjects (8 subjects) tested (SIDS (2004)).</rationale>

As relevant information, from in vitro mutagenicity tests, there are reports of a negative Ames test (SIDS (2004)), and a positive only without metabolic activation in Chinese hamster lung cell chromosomal aberration test (SIDS (2004)). The substance is an existing chemical substance, for which mutagenicity was established under the provisions of Article 57-3 of the Industrial Safety and Health Law.</rationale>

    <rationale>In a one-generation reproduction toxicity test by oral administration to rats, no abnormality was found in mating, fertility, delivery and nursing condition. Furthermore, there was no effect on birth index, general condition and viability of the offspring. However, at the high dose where transient salivation and reduced bodyweight gain were observed in parental animals, there was an increase in the incidence of offspring with external malformations, such as kinked tail, brachyury or microphthalmus. Additionally, visceral malformations such as undescended testes, hypoplasia of the spleen or diaphragmatic hernia were observed. Although all malformations were found only in offspring of a few limited litters, it was concluded that teratogenicity could not be ruled out from the results of this test ("Toxicity Testing Reports of Environmental Chemicals" (Chemicals Investigation Promoting Council) (2005)). Therefore the substance was classified into Category 2.</rationale>

    <rationale>In a rat acute oral toxicity test (OECD TG401) (SIDS (2004)), reduced activity, prostrate and lateral positioning were observed at 315 - 800 mg/kg. Additionally, accelerated breathing and closure of eyes were observed at 1000 - 1250 mg/kg. Diarrhea was seen in all groups. At necropsy, dark coloration and light-coloured spots of the liver and hyperemia in the gastro-intestinal tracts were observed in animals that had died. Animals surviving at the end of the 14-day observation period were free of pathological changes. Since the LD50 value (823 - 1040 mg/kg) is within the guidance value range for Category 2 and the affected organ cannot be identified from above clinical signs and pathological findings, the substance was classified into Category 2 (systemic toxicity).</rationale>

    <rationale>In a rat 28-day repeat oral dose test (OECD TG407), changes in serum phosphate and serum bilirubin levels and increased liver weight were observed in the high dose group of 300 mg/kg/day (90-day equivalent: 93.3 mg/kg/day). Microscopically, necroses of the adrenal cortex were found in one female of the mid- and high-dose group (SIDS (2004)), however, there are insufficient data to consider these changes as exposure related effects. Additionally, from the report that kidney disturbances, increases in blood urea/nitrogen levels, and microscopically kidney changes including necroses were observed by 10-day inhalation exposure to rat at 100 mg/m3 (SIDS (2004)), the effect on the kidney is suggested. However, there were no effects on the kidney in the 28-day oral test and these information are reported in a citation document requiring confirmation of the original literature for classification. Therefore, classification was not possible.</rationale>
