(SIDS (2002)) Since these symptoms were seen within the range of the guidance value of Category 2, it was classified into Category 2 (kidney, central nervous system). This substance is a corrosive substance to the skin and the eye, and the hyperplasia of the front stomach was considered to be due to the irritation to the digestive system due to forced oral administration, thus, it was excluded from target organ. </rationale>
