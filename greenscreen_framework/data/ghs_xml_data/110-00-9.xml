There is a description as follows in the committee meeting minute (year 2000) of the working group for EU Classification, "Based on the study results of NTP, a proposal was made by Germany to change it to Category 3 (corresponding to GHS Category 2) and has been in the process of continuous deliberation." </rationale>

Moreover, "There is Respiratory tract irritation" is indicated by ICSC (1995). Therefore, it is classified into Category 2 (central nervous system, digestive system, liver) and Category 3 (Respiratory tract irritation). In addition, primary literature (NTP Executive Summary:Furan (Draft) (1986)) of HSDB (1996) could not be obtained, and it was not able to check for details. </rationale>

    <rationale>In NTP TR402 (1993) in Priority 1 there are reports of liver injury (cholangiofibrosis, hypertrophy, chronic inflammation, giant cell tumors, etc.) and kidney injury (tubular dilatation, tubular epithelial necrosis) in a 2-year chronic toxicity study in rats and mice (maximum dose concentration: 8mg/kg/day), as well as atrophy in the testes and ovaria in a 13-week subacute oral toxicity study in rats (dose concentration: 60mg/kg/day). In RTECS (1995)of Priority 2, there is a description of abnormalities in the structure or function of trachea or bronchus in the study where the value in the rat treated with 4-hr inhalation for 60 days of LOAEL: 0.2mg/L (equivalent to the guidance value of Category 2) was obtained, and of abnormalities in central nervous system in the study where the value in the rat treated with 4-hr inhalation for 26 weeks of LOAEL: 0.005mg/L (equivalent to the guidance value of Category 1" was obtained. Referring to the primary literature of RTECS (Toksikologiya Novykh Promyshlennykh Khimicheskikh Veshchestv, 9, 106 (1967), ibid., 10, 35 (1968)), the former tracheal or bronchial abnormalities are accompanied by local lung emphysema under the exposure condition where the rat treated with 2-hr/day inhalation for 30 days of 1.0-1.3mg/L (equivalent to the guidance value of Category 1), but the latter symptoms of central nervous system are considered to have been seen in the study to obtain the lethal dose (LC50) and there was no description of functional disorder of central nerve in the subacute and chronic toxicity studies. Therefore, it is defined as Category 1 (liver, kidney, respiratory system) and Category 2 (testis, ovaria). Moreover, since the result of atrophy of testis and ovaria in the rat given a dose of 60mg/kg/day was obtained in the subacute toxicity study and there is no description of effects on ability of reproduction and offspring, it was determined as a rationale for classification of this hazardous property. </rationale>
