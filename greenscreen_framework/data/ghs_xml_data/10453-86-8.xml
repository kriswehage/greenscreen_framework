    <rationale>There is a description that the animal exposed to Resmethrin "shows nerve tremor, excitement, convulsive muscle contraction, collapse, and coma" as acute symptoms (EHC 92 (1989)). Moreover, when the cited literature of the test data described in HSDB (2001) (Environ.Health Perspect.14 (1976)) was investigated, there were descriptions of "Nerve tremor and ataxia were seen 30 minutes to 3 hours after exposure, sensitive reaction in the oral administration test employing rats and mice of Resmethrin and of "Ataxia and incontinence of urine were seen at the time of high concentration exposure." in 4 hours mist inhalation exposure test for employing rats and mice of , (+)-Trans &amp; Cis-reaction." This substance consists of four sorts of isomer mixtures. In consideration of the degree of the toxicity varying depending on compounding ratio, the central nervous system was considered to be the target organ from these findings. Moreover, since the effect was seen within the range of the guidance value of Category 2, it was classified into Category 2 (central nervous system). In addition, the section of the effect of short term exposures in ICSC (2002) has a description of "The nervous system may be affected" for Cis-resmethrin which is one of the composition ingredients of this substance. </rationale>
