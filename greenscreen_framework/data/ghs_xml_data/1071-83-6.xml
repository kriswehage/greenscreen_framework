Based on its saturated vapour pressure of 2.6*10^-9 mg/L (vapour pressure: 2.89*10^-10 mmHg, Howard, 1997), it is estimated that the substance tested was in a dust state. Since it is difficult to determine if these LC50 values fall under Category 4 or "Not classified," the substance was classified into "Classification not possible".</rationale>

    <rationale>Among three rabbit tests conducted (complied with the US EPA guidelines or OECD TG 405, GLP), there were cases in which some symptoms did not recover during the 21-day observation period. In the first test, corneal opacity and conjunctival irritation with blistering (all of 6 animals treated), pannus of the cornea (3 of 6 animals treated), vascularization of the conjunctiva (1 of 6 animals treated), and blood like discharge (1 of 6 animals treated) were observed; and 3 of 5 animals developed these symptoms did not recover in 21 days (EHC, 1994). In the second test, all animals showed corneal opacity, conjunctival redness, and chemosis, and these symptoms persisted for 21 days (JMPR, 2004). Similarly, in the third test, symptoms related to the cornea, iris and conjunctiva were observed, and mild reaction to the treatment by the cornea persisted for 21 days (EHC, 1994). Based on these results, the substance was classified into Category 1. The substance has been rated R41 in the EU classification, which is equivalent to Category 1.</rationale>

Also, weakly positive results were obtained from a micronucleus test using mice that underwent intraperitoneal administration, and positive results were also shown in DNA damage tests (JMPR (2004)). On the other hand, in in vitro tests, many negative results have been recorded in Ames tests (JMPR (2004)), mouse lymphoma assays (JMPR (2004)), HGPRT tests using CHO cells (HSDB (2006)), and cytogenetical tests using human lymphocytes (JMPR, 2004).</rationale>

    <rationale>In two-year mixed diet tests using rats (SD) (complied with the US EPA guidelines or OECD TG 453, GLP), a significant increase in rates of developing pancreatic islet cell adenomas was observed in male animals treated with low doses. However, there is a description that "the incidence in the control group was below the historical control range; the trend test for the observed increase was negative. No pancreatic carcinomas were found" (EHC, 1994), referring to the same test, the JMPR concluded that "administration of glyphosate to Sprague-Dawley rats for 24 months produced no signs of carcinogenic potential." (JMPR, 2004). Similarly, in two-year mixed diet tests using rats (Alpk: APfSD) (Wistar-derived) (complied with the US EPA guidelines or OECD TG 453, GLP), no statistically significant, dose-dependent increase in rates of developing tumors was observed (JMPR, 2004). Likewise, in 104-week mixed diet tests using mice (complied with the US EPA guidelines or OECD TG 451, GLP), a statistically significant increase in rates of developing tumors was not detected in either sex (JMPR, 2004). In addition, the substance is rated as D in the EPA's carcinogenicity classification, which is equivalent to "Not classified". Based on these results, the substance was classified into "Not classified".</rationale>

    <rationale>Of two teratogenicity tests using rabbits conducted (OECD TG 414, GLP), one test resulted in increased embryotic deaths, an increase in rates of postimplantation loss, and a few cases of interventricular septal defect and other abnormalities affecting the heart in fetuses at the doses (150 and 450 mg/kg bw /day) that induce general toxicity in parental animals (reduction in food intake, soft/liquid feaces, or body weight loss) (JMPR, 2004). In the other test, a partial ossification (vertebrae and sternebra) and reduction in ossification (manus) were observed in fetuses at the dose (300 mg/kg bw /day) that induces general toxicity in parental animals (reduced food consumption, diarrhea, or suppressed body weight gain). However, these toxic effects were detected only at low and high doses and not at intermediate doses (JMPR, 2004). In two-generation reproductive toxicity tests (complied with the US EPA guidelines or OECD TG 416, GLP), no effect on sexuality and fertility were observed at the doses that induce general toxicity in parental animals (decreased food and water consumptions, lower body weight, or cellular alterations of the salivary gland) (JMPR, 2004). In teratogenicity tests using rats (complied with the US EPA guidelines or OECD TG 414, GLP), a slight increase in reduced ossification and skeletal variation (wavy ribs) was observed in fetuses at the dose (1000 mg/kg bw /day) that induces general toxicity in parental animals (suppressed body weight gain and respiratory changes) (JMPR, 2004). However, in a different teratogenicity test using rats (OECD TG 414, GLP), no effects were observed in either parental animals or fetuses at the same dose (1000 mg/kg bw / day). There is a comment by the JMPR that "the existing database on glyphosate was adequate to characterize the potential hazards to fetuses, infants, and children." Based on these results, the substance was classified into Category 2.</rationale>

Through dermal route exposure, these signs (reduced activity and sedation) were not detected in either rats or rabbits (JMPR, 2004). Through inhalation exposure in two rat tests, animals were slightly subdued in one test; however, auditory hypoaesthesia and a reduced righting reflex, as well as irregular breathing were observed in the other test (JMPR, 2004). Furthermore, at the administration dose of 4.43 mg/L (4h), dark lungs were detected in cases of death (two of five dead males) (JMPR, 2004). Based on these results, the substance was classified into Category 3 (narcotic effects) in terms of oral and inhalation route exposure.</rationale>

Similarly, in a different 104-week repeated oral administration test using rats (the US EPA guidelines, GLP), cytoplasmic alteration in the parotid and submandibular salivary glands was observed at the administration dose of 100 mg/kg bw /day or higher in a dose-dependent fashion (JMPR, 2004). Thus, the substance was classified into Category 2 (salivary gland) in terms of oral route exposure.
In addition, in three-week repeated dermal administration tests using rabbits (GLP), no effects were observed at 100 mg/kg bw /day or higher in terms of hematology, blood biochemistry, organ weight, and pathological test.</rationale>
