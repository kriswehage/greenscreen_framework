    <rationale>In 2-year oral administration tests using rats or mice, survival rates in female and male rats and female mice decreased in the highest dose groups due to mortality caused by convulsions before and after administration. However, incidences of tumorigenesis did not increase in association with the test substance, and thus, no evidence of its carcinogenic effects was found (NTP TR312 (1986)). In EPA's carcinogenicity evaluation, this substance is rated as D (not classifiable as to human carcinogenicity) (IRIS (2005)). Based on these test results and existing classification, the substance was classified into the "Not classified" category.</rationale>

    <rationale>In preliminary reproduction toxicity screening tests using rats that underwent oral exposure (OECD TG), though effects of the exposure on sexual functions and fertility in parental animals were not detected, reduced survival rates of offspring during the nursing period as related to high numbers of neonate mortality in the highest dose groups (Toxicity Testing Reports of Environmental Chemicals (Chemicals Investigation Promoting Council), accessed in October 2008). In other oral exposure tests conducted during the gestation period, the offspring were crossbred and subsequently evaluated; as a result, embryo mortality increased in the second generation (NTP TR312 (1986)). It is documented that these adverse effects on the offspring occur only at the doses that cause general toxicity in parental animals such as a decreased body weight, or high doses that show strong toxicity. Based on these observations, the substance was classified into Category 2.</rationale>

However, since this study is outdated (conducted in 1932) and was carried out for different purposes, it was not used as grounds for classification.

    <rationale>In reproduction toxicity screening tests using rats that underwent oral administration, no signs of serious toxic effects were noted in males treated with the highest dose of 300 mg/kg/day, other than suppressed body weight gain, reduced food consumption, and salivation being observed (Toxicity Testing Reports of Environmental Chemicals (Chemicals Investigation Promoting Council), accessed in October 2008). In addition, in 14-day, 13-week, and 103-week oral administration tests using rats, cases of mortality accompanied with convulsions were detected in the highest dose groups in each study; however, doses of the test substance that fall under the range of guidance values do not show any adverse effects; furthermore, in the 13-week administration study, NOAEL was found to be 120 mg/kg/day (NTP TR312 (1986)). These results indicate that the substance falls under the "Not classified" category (oral route) since administration doses in the range of guidance values did not show adverse effects in treated animals. However, due to lack of test results on other administration routes, the substance was classified into "Classification not possible".</rationale>
