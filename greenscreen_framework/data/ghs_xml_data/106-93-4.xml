    <rationale>Although significant irritation accompanied by erythema and edema which progress to necrosis and eschar was observed with repetitive application on shaved rabbit abdominal, it is described that it recovered completely within seven days after the end of exposure (EHC 177 (1996)). On humans, from the results of single exposure test on skin, it is judged to have serious stimulativeness (IUCLID (2000)), and other reports indicate severe irritation (EHC 177 (1996), PATTY (5th, 2001), ATSDR (1992)). From these information, this product may result in corrosion. So it was judged to have severe irritation, it was classified as Category 2.</rationale>

    <rationale>Due to the descriptions that the liver fatty metamorphosis, centrilobular necrosis, and proximal convoluted tubules of kidneys were observed by suicide attempt or mistaking (EHC 177(1996), PATTY (5th, 2001), IARC 71(1999), ACGIH (2001), BUA 66 (1991)), and that centrilobular fatty change degenerations and necrosis in hepatic and renal tubule edema in liver were observed also in rat  (EHC 177 (1996)). So it was classified into Category 1 (liver, kidney). Moreover, due to the descriptons that there are some reports which mistaking for the anesthetic in humans caused poisoning (ACGIH (2001), BUA 66 (1991)), furthermore, that it affects to central nervous systems and causes an awareness decreases is caused (ICSC (1993)), it was classified into Category 1 (central nervous system).

Moreover, a potential that humans will also affect liver and the kidney as effect of long-term or repeated exposure is suggested (ICSC (1993)), and inhalation exposure of a guinea pigs with the concentration (0.385 mg/L (50 ppm) (80 days) (the equivalent on the 90 days: 0.342 mg/L)) as equivalent to the guidance value Category 2, mild centrilobular fatty degeneration in liver, interstitial congestion and edema in the kidney were observed (EHC 177 (1996)).
