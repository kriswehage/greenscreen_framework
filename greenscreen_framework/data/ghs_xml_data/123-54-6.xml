    <rationale>Negative results were obtained from in vivo mutagenicity tests using somatic cells (micronucleus tests using the bone marrow cells of mice that underwent inhalation exposure, micronucleus tests using the bone marrow cells of rats that underwent intraperitoneal administration or inhalation exposure, and chromosomal aberration tests using the bone marrow cells of mice and rats) and in vivo mutagenicity tests using germ cells (chromosomal aberration tests using mouse spermatogonia) (SIDS (accessed inaccessed June 2008)). Thus, the substance was classified into "Not classified". In dominant lethal tests using mice, though slight effects of the substance were observed, it was thought to be attributed to unusually low control values. Among in vitro mutagenicity tests, Ames tests yielded weak positive results with Salmonella TA104, mutation tests using CHO cells yielded negative results, and chromosomal aberration tests yielded positive results under the presence of S9 (SIDS (accessed in June 2008)). Although positive results have been obtained from micronucleus tests using peripheral blood of mice that underwent intraperitoneal administration, the results were judged to be invalid by the expert.</rationale>

    <rationale>In inhalation exposure tests using pregnant rats during the organogenetic period, decreased body weight gain in maternal animals, decreased fetal weight, and delayed ossification were observed at a high administration dose (400ppm). However, no effects were observed in indicators of conception and development, and frequencies of malformation in external surfaces, organs, and skeletons were not different between treated and control animals (SIDS (accessed June 2008)). However, due to insufficient data regarding the effects of the substance on reproductive functions and fertility of parental animals that were exposed prior to mating, classification is not possible.</rationale>

    <rationale>After rats were orally exposed to the substance at doses &gt;= 485mg/kg and near the LD50, trembling, unsteady gait, coma, and narcosis were observed. After rats were exposed through inhalation at concentrations &gt;= 2.619mg/L and near LC50, tremors, ataxia, decreased motor activity, a negative tail and toe pinch reflex, and a slow righting reflex were observed (SIDS (accessed in June 2008)). Furthermore, after rabbits were dermally exposed at 790-1370mg/kg, narcosis and coma were observed (SIDS (accessed in June 2008)). In humans that underwent inhalation exposure, dizziness and loss of consciousness were observed (SIDS (accessed in June 2008)). Based on these observations in both animals and humans, the substance was classified into Category 3 (narcotic effects). Moreover, in rats that underwent inhalation exposure, forced respiration, lacrimation, and encrustation around the eyes and nose were observed (SIDS (accessed in June 2008)), and in humans, the substance is documented to be irritating to the respiratory tracts (HSDB (2007)). Thus, the substance was classified into Category 3 (respiratory tract irritation).</rationale>

    <hazard_statement>May cause damage to organs through prolonged or repeated exposure (central nervous system, thymus)</hazard_statement>
    <rationale>In repeated oral route exposure tests using rats that were treated 10-11 times during a 2 week period, mortality, laboured breathing, trembling, motor ataxia, necrosis of the thymus, and inflammation of mesenteric lymph nodes were observed at 500mg/kg/day or higher doses. Inhalation and skin exposure tests using rats also resulted in development of similar symptoms at high administration doses. Furthermore, because histopathological changes, such as neurodegradation of the brain and lymphocytic degradation of the thymus, were detected, general symptoms caused by the 2-week oral route exposure were thought to be the effects of the substance on the central nervous system. Since oral route exposure was conducted at 500mg/kg/day (90-day conversion: 76.9mg/kg/day) which is equivalent to the Category 2 guidance values, and since lymphocytic degradation of the thymus was observed, the substance was classified into Category 2 (central nervous system and thymus).</rationale>
