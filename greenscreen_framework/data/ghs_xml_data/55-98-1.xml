    <rationale>Based on the classification of "Group 1" in IARC (IARC 100 (2008)), the substance was classified into Category 1A. Several reports described dysplasias and atypical cell formation among leukemia patients who have received treatment and a few cases of cancer were reported. Among animal tests, it was reported that administration to rats by oral or to mice by intraperitoneal injection did not significantly increase the incidence of tumors but intravenous administration to mice significantly increased the incidence of thymic lymphomas and ovarian tumours (IARC vol. 4 (1974)).</rationale>

    <rationale>There is a case report that treatment of a pre-adolescent girl with the substance prevented the onset of puberty due to ovarian failure (HSDB (2009)). Examination of 21 girls, aged 11 - 21 years, who had earlier received several years of high-dose chemotherapy and autologous bone marrow transplantation, demonstrated that the 10 girls who received the substance all developed severe and persistent ovarian failure (HSDB (2009)). A woman treated with the substance throughout the majority of her pregnancy gave birth to an infant with severe growth retardation, cleft palate, microphthalmia and hypoplastic ovaries. It was concluded that these malformations were caused by the substance (Birth Defects (3rd, 2000)). A case of myeloschisis in a six week old human embryo was reported for a mother treated with the substance before and during the early stages of gestation for leukemia (Birth Defects (3rd, 2000)). Additionally, there is a report of a infant with multiple malformations whose mother was treated with the substance for lukemia during gestation (Birth Defects (3rd, 2000)). The substance is classified into Category D (There is positive evidence of human fetal risk, but potential benefits may warrant use of the drug in pregnant women despite potential risks) from FDA (The Merck Manual (18th, Japanese)). Based on all this information, the substance corresponds to a known human reproductive toxicant and is classified into Category 1A. From animal tests, there is a report that microencephaly and microphthalmia were observed in the embryos/fetuses from rats exposed intraperitoneally during gestation (HSDB (2009)) and a report that the substance is teratogenic in mice, rats and rabbits (EMEA (2005)).</rationale>

    <classification>Category 2 (blood system, nervous system, lung, liver)</classification>
    <hazard_statement>May cause damage to organs (blood system, nervous system, lung, liver)</hazard_statement>
    <rationale>Based on a report that the major adverse effect of the substance is hematologic toxicity and causes myelosuppression manifested as leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, or any combination of these (HSDB (2009)), the blood system was regarded as a target organ. Based on reports that seizures were reported in patients receiving the substance orally, including administration at high doses as part of a conditioning regimen prior to bone marrow transplantation (HSDB (2009)) and that two patients without prior histories of neurologic disorders experienced generalized seizures while receiving high-doses of the substance as part of a preparative regimen for allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (HSDB (2009)), the nervous system was regarded as a target organ. Since interstitial pneumonitis and pulmonary fibrosis have also been reported in patients receiving high oral doses as a component of a conditioning regimen prior to allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (HSDB (2009)) and nonspecific interstitial fibrosis was diagnosed by lung biopsy in one patient receiving IV administration who subsequently died from respiratory failure (HSDB (2009)), the lung was regarded as a target organ. Additionally, hyperbilirubinemia was reported in patients receiving oral or IV administration of the substance as a component of a conditioning regimen prior to allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant. Since the substance was associated with hepatic veno-occlusive disease in some patients and jaundice, hepatomegaly and increases in serum ALT were reported (HSDB (2009)), the liver was regarded as a target organ. Since these information are reported in a document in List 2, the substance was classified into Category 2 (blood system, nervous system, lung, liver). From animal tests, there are signs of stimulation of the central nervous system with convulsions in mice following a one-time exposure (HSDB (2009)).</rationale>

    <rationale>Based on a report that the major adverse effect of the substance is hematologic toxicity and causes myelosuppression manifested as leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, or any combination of these (HSDB (2009)) and a report that the substance can suppress hemopoiesis resulting in aplastic anemia (DHP (13th, 2002)), the blood system is regarded as a target organ. From a report that a rare, but serious syndrome which occurs only after long-term therapy (4 months to 10 years) is manifested by bronchopulmonary dysplasia with a diffuse interstitial pulmonary fibrosis and is characterized by persistent cough, fever, rales, and dyspnea (HSDB (2009)), the lung is regarded as a target organ. Since corneal thinning and lens changes also were reported in patients receiving oral administration (HSDB (2009)) and the occurrence of cataract was reported after long-term administration (HSDB (2009)), the eye is also regarded as a target organ. Since hyperpigmentation was reported in 5 - 10% of patients receiving oral administration and erythema nodosum, erythema multiforme, urticaria, porphyria cutanea tarda, and dryness of the skin also were reported in patients treated orally (HSDB (2009)), the skin is regarded as a target organ. Additionally, since infections including sepsis and pneumonia were reported in patients receiving the substance and wasting or Addison-like syndrome has occurred in a small number of patients after long-term therapy (HSDB (2009)), systemic toxicity is also an adverse effect. Since these information are reported in a document in List 2, the substance was classified into Category 2 (blood system, lung, eye, skin, systemic toxicity).</rationale>
