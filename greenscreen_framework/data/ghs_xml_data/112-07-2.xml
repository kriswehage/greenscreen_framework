In other tests, only slight irritation was observed in 4 out of 6 animals, which reflected the primary skin irritation index value of 0.17 (SIDS (accessed June 2008)). Furthermore, in 4-hour exposure tests, the substance was evaluated to be not irritating, and the average score for erythema was the lowest possible value for irritants (ATSDR (1998)). From these results, the substance was classified into "Not classified" in accordance with JIS classification criteria (Category 3 in GHS classification).</rationale>

    <rationale>Since this substance is hydrolyzed into butyl ether in the body, use of data on ethylene glycol monobutyl ether is appropriate for evaluation of ethylene glycol monobutyl ether acetate (SIDS (accessed June 2008)). In 2-year inhalation exposure tests using rats and mice that were applied with ethylene glycol monobutyl ether, frequencies of developing both benign and malignant pheochlromocytoma in adrenal medulla increased in female rats, making the results ambiguous. However, in mice, occurrences of angiosarcoma in livers increased in males, and occurrences of squamous papilloma or squamous cell carcinoma increased in females, providing evidence of carcinogenicity (SIDS (accessed June 2008)). Based on these results and the fact that this substance has been classified into A3 by ACGIH (2003), the substance was classified into Category 2.</rationale>

In these tests, surviving offspring numbers decreased due to the treatment (SIDS (accessed June 2008)). In oral route or inhalation exposure tests using rats, rabbits, or mice that were exposed to the substance during the organogenetic period, decreased numbers of surviving implantation and fetuses, increased numbers of non living implantation and resorption of embryos, and loss of implanted embryos were observed at doses that trigger maternal toxicity (SIDS (accessed June 2008), ATSDR (1998)). However, since no direct data on this very substance were available, classification is not possible.</rationale>

    <rationale>In dermal acute toxicity tests using rats (LD50 = 1500mg/kg: equivalent to Category 2), the following are documented: hemoglobinuria, bloody urine, decreased erythrocytes / hemoglobin, and necrosis of renal tubules accompanied with glomerular lesion of kidneys. In oral acute toxicity tests (LD50 = 2400-3300mg/kg: equivalent to "Not classified"), hemoglobinuria, bloody urine, nephrosis, expansion of renal tubules, necrosis of renal tubules, and degeneration of hyaline droplets were observed. In addition, hemoglobinuria and bloody urine have been also observed by inhalation exposure at 400ppm (2.6mg/L: equivalent to Category 2), although they were less severe. Based on toxic symptoms observed with oral and dermal administrations, erythrocytes and kidneys were considered as target organs; and the LD50 values for these organs indicated that these symptoms occurred at the doses in the range of Category 2 guidance values or higher. Thus, the substance was classified into Category 2 (erythrocyte, kidney).</rationale>

    <rationale>In 30-day inhalation tests using rats (4-hour exposure), mortality, hemoglobinuria, hematuria, decreased numbers of erythrocytes and hemoglobin, hypertrophy of the kidneys, and nephrosis were observed at 400 ppm/4h (90-day, 6-hour correction: ca.0.71mg/L/6h). In addition, 4-week inhalation exposure tests using rats, rabbits, or cats (6-hour exposure), characteristics of anemia, such as decreased hemoglobin, hematocrit, and erythrocytes, were observed at 2.3mg/L (90-day equivalent: ca. 0.71mg/L), which is the dose equivalent to Category 2 guidance values (SIDS (accessed in June 2008)). Thus, the substance was classified into Category 2 (hematopoietic system). As relevant notes, ethylene glycol monobutyl ether, a byproduct resulted from hydrolysis of ethylene glycol monobutyl ether acetate in the body, was also studied. Applying this byproduct at 62.5-125 ppm (Category 2 equivalent) or above to rats and mice in 14-week inhalation exposure tests, hemolytic anemia was shown in both animals, and signs of anemia were observed in the liver, kidney, bone marrow, and spleen (SIDS (accessed in June 2008)).</rationale>
