    <rationale>In 2-year oral administration tests using rats (CD strain) (male: 0, 1.93, 5.71, 17.06 and 22.8mg/kg/day; female: 0, 2.43, 7.23, 19.45 and 23.98mg/kg/day), tremors were detected as an effect severity of which was correlated with amount of exposure. Other effects related to the test substance or pathological abnormalities that severity was correlated with amount of exposure were not detected (IRIS (2002)). In joint chronic toxicity / carcinogenicity tests using rats (CD strain) (0, 50, 150, 450 and 600 ppm mixed diet), which is presumed to be the same as above-mentioned study, no consistent changes that were related to administration were not detected in hematological, blood biochemistry and histopathological examinations conducted. In addition, with regard to all tumors observed, rates of development were not different between control and treated groups; thus, the test was negative for carcinogenicity (Pesticide Safety Information (Japan Crop Protection Association) (Sumitomo Chemical 1989-II)). Moreover, in 2-year oral administration tests using mice (male: 0, 3.9, 13.7 and 56mg/kg/day; female: 0, 4.2, 16.2 and 65.2mg/kg/day), any exposure-related toxicity was not detected other than marginally increased hyperactivity in female (IRIS (2002)). In combined chronic toxicity / carcinogenicity tests using rats (CD strain) (0, 40, 150 and 600 ppm mixed diet), which is presumed to be the same as above-mentioned study, no administration-related changes were observed in terms of either non-neoplastic or neoplastic changes inspected in histopathological examinations; thus, the test was negative for carcinogenicity (Pesticide Safety Information (Japan Crop Protection Association) (Sumitomo Chemical 1989-II)). From this information, the substance was classified into the "Not classified" category.</rationale>

    <rationale>In 2-generation oral administration tests using rats, no effects of exposure (at the concentrations (6.0 and 18 mg/kg/day) that induce parental toxicity) were detected using various parameters related to fertility such as pregnancy rate, birthrate and mating ratio; thus, there were no effects on fertility (Pesticide Safety Information (Japan Crop Protection Association) (Sumitomo Chemical 1989-II)). On the other hand, in 3-generation oral administration tests, an increase in tremors and mortality was detected in F2b offspring at the exposure concentrations that cause parental toxicity, while there were no effects of exposure on reproductive toxicity (IRIS (2002)). In developmental toxicity tests using rats (from day 6 to day 15 of pregnancy: 0, 0.4, 1.5, 2, 3, 6 or 10 mg/kg/day), no skeletal malformations were detected at the exposure concentrations that cause parental toxicity, indicating that NOEL is higher than the highest concentration (10 mg/kg/day) tested (IRIS (2002)). In developmental toxicity tests using rabbits (from day 7 to day 19 of pregnancy: 0, 4, 12 or 36 mg/kg/day), no exposure related abnormalities or malformation were detected at the exposure concentrations that cause parental toxicity (IRIS (2002)). From this information, the substance was classified into Category 2 based on the results of 3-generation tests in that an increase in tremors and mortality was detected in offspring at the exposure concentrations that cause parental toxicity.</rationale>

    <rationale>In acute toxicity tests using rats, muscle cramp, tremors, atactic gait and irregular respiration were observed at the toxic dose (Pesticide Safety Information (Japan Crop Protection Association) (Sumitomo Chemical 1989-II)). Since the LD50 value is 60-164 mg/kg bw, it is presumed that muscle cramp, tremors, atactic gait and irregular respiration occurred at the exposure concentrations which fall under the range of Category 1 guidance values (&lt;= 300 mg/kg bw). Although the substance is to be placed in Category 1 based on the guidance values, it was classified into Category 2 (nervous system) because the results were obtained using List 2 data.</rationale>

    <rationale>In 3-month oral administration tests using rats (0, 0.1, 0.5, 2.5 and 12.5 mg/kg/day), no exposure-related toxic effects were detected, and NOEL was found to be &gt;= 12.5 mg/kg/day (IRIS (2002)). On the other hand, in 3-month oral administration tests using rats (0, 0.15, 1.5, 15 and 30 mg/kg-day), occurrence of tremors was detected during the fifth week after administration, and the symptom disappeared by Week 11 in female rats in the highest dose groups (30 mg/kg/day) (IRIS (2002)); and in 13-week oral administration tests using dogs (doses: 0, 250, 500 and 750 ppm (conversion values: 0, 6.25, 12.5 and 18.75 mg/kg bw/day)), occurrence of ataxia, tremors, lethargy and panting was observed. In particular, because tremors (IRIS (2002)) were detected at the dosage group equivalent to Category 2 guidance values (18.75 mg/kg bw /day), the substance was classified into Category 2 (nervous system). As relevant notes, in 13-week oral administration tests using dogs, low values were found in blood examination parameters (hematocrits, hemoglobin, and erythrocytes); and in inhalation tests using rats (no record of exposure time available), normocytic anemia, change in blood composition (e.g., TP, bilirubin, and cholesterol), and change in cholinesterase were documented (RTECS (2007)).</rationale>
