In other Draize tests using rabbits treated with 50% solution, the score was 48 out of 110 on Day 21 after the application in rabbits whose eyes were not rinsed (the scores were 27 out of 110 in rabbits whose eyes were rinsed 4 minutes after the application, and 0 out 110 in rabbits whose eyes were rinsed 21 days after the application), which is considered highly irritating (IUCLID (2000)). Furthermore, since its preexisting rating for skin irritation / corrosion is Category 1, the substance was classified into Category 1.</rationale>

    <rationale>A skin sensitization test using guinea pigs showed that the substance was sensitizing (positive reactions were seen in 2 of 10 animals), while two other skin sensitization tests using guinea pigs concluded that it was not sensitizing (IUCLID (2000)).

In dermal administration tests (IARC (1991); NTP TR. No. 392 (1992); IUCLID (2000)), carcinogenicity was not detected either.</rationale>

Similarly, in reproduction tests using mice or rats that were orally administered, no effects on fertility or fetuses were detected (IUCLID (2000)). Furthermore, in developmental toxicity tests using rats that were orally administered, no effects were recognized at the highest dose of 100 mg/kg applied, except for a decreased body weight and increased skeletal variation in offspring (IUCLID (2000)). Based on these results, the substance was classified into "Not classified".</rationale>

    <rationale>The substance was classified into Category 3 (respiratory tract irritation) based on the description that the substance causes coughing and choking through inhalation of the mist, and it may cause severe respiratory tract irritation and pulmonary edema (HSDB (2003)). Furthermore, several cases of accidental intake of bleach by humans were documented in which corrosiveness of the substance affected the esophagus and stomach (IUCLID (2000)). Also, the intake of the solution was reported to have caused hemorrhagic ulcer accompanied with necrosis of the stomach and intestine (IUCLID (2000)). Based on these documents, the substance was also classified into Category 2 for the digestive system.</rationale>

In the tests using rats that underwent forced oral administration for 14 days (doses: 8, 40, and 200 mg/kg; 90-day conversion: 0.22, 6.67, and 33.3 mg/kg), changes in kidney weight were observed (IARC (1991)). And in the tests using rats that underwent administration in drinking water for 14 days (dose: 625 mg/L, 90-day conversion: 4.86 mg/kg), changes in amount of water intake were observed (IARC (1991)). Other than these changes, no toxic effects of the substance were detected. Since the information on toxic effects at the doses in the range of guidance values is not available in any of the tests, classification is not possible. In addition, oral administration tests using rats or mice have been conducted, but no information is provided other than subtle changes in immunological parameters (IUCLID (2000); (RTECS (2008)); thus, classification is not possible due to lack of data.</rationale>
