    <rationale>In 103-week oral administration (0-300mg/kg) tests using mice (B6C3F1), squamous cell papilloma was detected in the forestomach and it was thought to be attributed to the substance. However, the tests were not conducted with the maximum tolerance dose, and did not provided sufficient data (NTP TR 242, 1983). In 103-week oral administration (0-100mg/kg) tests using rats, mononuclear cell leukemia and bile duct hyperplasia were observed in females administered at 100mg/kg. However, highly variable data made the results ambiguous (NTP TR 284, 1985). As such, information on its carcinogenic effects is insufficient, and thus the substance was classified into "Classification not possible".</rationale>

    <rationale>In one-generation reproduction tests using rats (SD), maternal animals, treated with a toxic dose of 150mg/kg/day, failed to complete parturition, and dystocia was frequently observed as a secondary consequence of its general toxicity. No abnormality was observed in terms of numbers of corpora lutea, implantation site, rates of losing pre- and post-implantation embryos, and survival rates of the offspring. Although atrophy of epididymis was observed in male rats, there was no significant difference in epididymides weights relative to bodyweight. (SIDS, accessed in July 2008). Overall, since other information on reproductive toxicity in males was lacking, the substance was classified into "Classification not possible".</rationale>

    <rationale>In inhalation (aerosol) tests using rats, the animals developed irritation in the eyes and respiratory passages and central nervous system, but these were symptoms detected in dead animals (DFGOT (vol.9, 2007)). In oral administration tests using rats and dermal administration tests using dogs, oedematous haemorrhage in the lung, intestine and liver and pulmonary congestion were the most common symptoms observed. However, no information on administration doses was provided. In addition, periportal liver cell necrosis in dogs (administration doses unspecified), and increased levels of the enzymes aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and alkaline phosphatase were found (DFGOT (vol.9, 2007)). High levels of ALT were also observed in rats (Fischer 344) that received doses of 400mg/kg bw, and in mice (B6C3F1) that received instillation (i.v.) of 900mg/kg bw (DFGOT (vol.9, 2007)). Thus, based on high levels of enzymes detected in treated dogs and rats (Fischer 344), and since this substance is documented to be hepatotoxic (PATTY (5th, 2001)), the substance was classified into Category 2 (liver).</rationale>

    <rationale>In 13-week oral administration tests using rats (Fischer 344) (GLP-compliant), symptoms such as cell degeneration around the portal veins at 50, 100, and 200mg/kg (males: 3/10, 2/10 and 9/10; and females: 0/0, 8/10, 10/10), necrosis at 200mg/kg (males: 5/10; and females: 7/10), fibrosis at 200mg/kg (males: 5/10; and females: 4/10), cirrhosis at 400mg/kg (males: 10/10), and bile duct hyperplasia at 200mg/kg (males: 8/10) were observed. Similarly, in 40-54-day oral administration tests using rats (Crj:Cd) (0-150mg/kg, OECD guidelines 421, GLP-compliant), symptoms such as fibrosis around the portal veins at 150mg/kg (90-day conversion: 67-90mg/kg) (males: 6/10; females: 9/10), necrosis (males: 5/10; females: 7/10), and bile duct hyperplasia (males: 6/10; females: 9/10) were observed. In oral administration (0-400mg/kg) tests using mice (B6C3F1), notable pathological changes were not observed. Based on these rat results (SIDS, accessed in July 2008; NTP TR 284, 1985; NTP TR 242, 1983), the substance was classified into Category 2 (liver).</rationale>
