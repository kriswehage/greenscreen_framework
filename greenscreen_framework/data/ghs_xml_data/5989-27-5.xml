Based on these results, as well as its R43 rating in the EU classification (which is equivalent to Category 1) (EU-Annex 1, accessed in December 2008) and Sh rating by the DFG (MAK/BAT (2007)), the substance was classified into Category 1.</rationale>

In life-long, forced oral administration tests using rats (F344/N), adenocarcinoma in renal tubular cells was observed only in males, and no signs of carcinogenicity were observed in females (CICADs No. 5, 1998). Additionally, in life-long, forced oral administration tests using mice (B6C3F1) (IARC vol. 73, 1999), no signs of carcinogenicity were detected. There is a description that the symptom observed in male rats is species and sex-dependent (CICADs No. 5, 1998). Accordingly, there are no suspected carcinogenic effects on humans, and the substance was classified into "Not classified".</rationale>

However, severity of these symptoms are unknown and information on the effects on reproductive functions in parental animals are not available; thus, classification is not possible.</rationale>

    <rationale>In 2-hour inhalation tests involving eight humans (10, 225, and 450 mg/m3), no abnormalities related to the central nervous system were detected other than slight decline in vital capacity in high concentration groups (CICAD (No. 5, 1998)). In oral administration tests (20 g) involving volunteers, diarrhoea, painful constriction, and proteinuria were detected, while no abnormalities related to the liver were observed (total proteins, bilirubin, cholesterol, and enzyme groups) (CICAD (No. 5, 1998)). In forced oral administration tests using rats (0-1200 mg/kg bw), no abnormalities were detected in hepatic triglyceride, microsomal proteins, hepatic cytochrome b5 or drug metabolizing enzyme group (JECFA (1993)). These results support that the substance is to be classified into the "Not classified" category for oral and inhalation routes, as no serious changes were observed in humans and animals. However, since data on dermal exposure are not available, in conclusion, the substance was classified into "Classification not possible". Also, in single administration tests using rats (Sprague-Dawley) (both sexes were treated with 0-409 mg/kg), the level of hyaline droplets became 10 in the animal groups treated with 409 mg/kg (compared with 3 in control groups). However, since the association between this substance and alpha-2u globulin has been reported, we judged that the symptoms observed are species and sex-dependent and these datasets cannot be used as grounds for classification.</rationale>

    <rationale>In 16-day forced oral route tests using rats (0-6600 mg/kg (90-day conversion: 73-1173 mg/kg)), no toxic symptoms or histological changes caused by this substance were detected in animal groups treated at 1650 mg/kg or lower doses (JECFA (1993)). In addition, in 30-day oral administration tests using rats that were treated with 0 to 2770 mg/kg (90-day correction: 92-923 mg/kg), no changes were detected in organ weight, urine, blood and biochemical examinations, except for the detection of granular casts in the kidneys (JECFA (1993)). Although these results found that oral-route administration of the substance fits in "Not classified" category, in conclusion, the substance was classified into "Classification not possible" due to lack of dermal and inhalation exposure data. Regarding the symptoms observed in male rats, the effects of alpha-2u globulin may have been involved, so it was not taken into consideration as grounds for the classification of the substance.</rationale>
