    <rationale>Although the result in a oral mouse dominant lethal test (in vivo heritable germ cell mutagenicity tests) was negative (IUCLID (2000)), there is conflicting information that analysis of bone marrow cells showed a higher number of chromosome aberrations in exposed animals than the control animals in a long term inhalation test (IUCLID (2000)). Therefore, classification was not possible due to difficult-to-determine. As relevant information, from in vitro mutagenicity tests, there are reports of positive for some strains of S. typhimurium and E.coli in bacteria reverse mutation test ("Toxicity Testing Reports of Environmental Chemicals" (Chemicals Investigation Promoting Council) (access on July. 2009)) and a negative in Chinese hamster lung fibroblast cell (CHL) chromosomal aberration test ("Toxicity Testing Reports of Environmental Chemicals" (Chemicals Investigation Promoting Council) (access on July 2009)).

In a two-year inhalation test in mice, increased incidences of bronchiolo-alveolar epithelial carcinoma and bronchiolo-alveolar epithelial adenoma in both sexes were observed (Japan Industrial Safety and Health Association: Results from Carcinogenicity Studies (Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (2004)).

    <rationale>In a rat test by oral administration at 500 - 2000 mg/kg (OECD TG401 (GLP)), clinical signs of decrease in locomotor activity, a prone position and ataxic gait were observed ("Toxicity Testing Reports of Environmental Chemicals" (Chemicals Investigation Promoting Council) (access on July 2009)). In another rat test by oral administration at 800-1600 mg/kg, clinical signs such as waddling gait, lethargy, decreased respiratory rate were observed (IUCLID (2000)). These dosages are within the guidance value range for Category 2. Additionally, there are report of edema and swelling of neural tissue of the brain as findings in a rat 4-hour inhalation test (vapour: LC50 = 6.5 - 7.27 mg/L) (IUCLID (2000)) and reports of CNS depression in acute experimental animal tests (HSDB (2002)). Although these results of inhalation tests correspond to Category 1 based on guidance value range, the substance was classified into Category 2 because of information in List 2 and a non-GLP test. Based on results of above oral and inhalation tests, the substance was classified into Category 2 (central nervous system). As relevant information, atrophy of the lung and pulmonary edema were observed in above oral rat test (OECD TG401), but this information was not used as the basis of classification since these lesions were observed in dead animals and similar effects were not observed by inhalation exposure.</rationale>

    <rationale>In rat and mouse 13-week inhalation tests, morphological changes such as hyperplasia of respiratory epithelia and disarrangement of olfactory epithelia in the nasal cavity and nasopharynx and hyperplasia and erosion of the forestomach were observed. Since the lowest observed effect level of 50 ppm/6h/day (0.322 mg/L/6h/day) is within the guidance value range for Category 2, the substance was classified into Category 2 (upper respiratory tract, stomach). Additionally, in a 28-day repeat dose toxicity test by oral administration to rats (the Chemical Substance Control Law (GLP)), centrilobular hypertrophy of hepatocytes in the animals of both sexes and atrophy of seminiferous tubules in the male animals were observed at 100 mg/kg/day (90-day equivalent: 31.1 mg/kg/day) and higher doses ("Toxicity Testing Reports of Environmental Chemicals" (Chemicals Investigation Promoting Council) (access on July 2009)). There is a report that liver changes included fatty degeneration and focal proliferation of the interstitial tissue cells, reduction in spermatozoa motility, degenerative changes in spermatogonia and spermatozoa were observed after long term inhalation at 0.045 mg/L to rats (IUCLID (2000)). Since these results indicate adverse effects on the liver and testis at dosing levels within the guidance value range for Category 2 or 1 with oral or inhalation exposure, respectively, and are reported in a document in List 2, the substance was classified into Category 2 (liver, testis).</rationale>
