    <rationale>In the tests using rabbits and rats, the substance induced edemas and caused irritation and inflammation (SIDS (accessed in July 2008). In addition, its pH is 11.6 (8.5g/L, 20degC). Based on the information, the substance was classified into Category 1. Repeated exposure resulted in severe effects with incrustation and necrosis, and the substance has been classified into R34 in the EU classification (EU-Annex (accessed in July 2008)).</rationale>

    <rationale>Application of the substance into the eyes of rabbits immediately caused severe damage, and necrosis in the conjunctivas was observed 24 hours after the application, leading to the conclusion that the substance was corrosive (SIDS (accessed July 2008)). Thus, the substance was classified into Category 1. Since the substance was corrosive, the test was conducted with only one animal and it was terminated 24 hours after the application.</rationale>

    <rationale>Positive results were obtained from several maximization tests using guinea pigs (including tests that were compliant with OECD Guidelines 406) (SIDS (accessed July 2008)). Furthermore, in humans, there have been many cases of positive reactions documented in case reports and epidemiological studies. In such documentation, humans who developed allergic contact dermatitis after undergoing occupational exposure tested positive in patch tests against this substance (SIDS (accessed July 2008)). Based on these facts, the substance was classified into Category 1.</rationale>

    <rationale>In 13-week oral route exposure tests using rats (OECD Guidelines 408), morphological changes such as an increased incidence in tubular basophilia and tubular casts along with a higher incidence of lymphoid foci were observed at the exposure dose of 160mg/kg/day, indicating nephrosis (SIDS (accessed in July 2008)). However, at the lower exposure dose of 60mg/kg/day, neither effects of the substance nor significant changes were observed. Consequently, this data cannot be used as a basis for classification. On the other hand, in 14-day inhalation exposure tests using rats, dose-dependent, histopathological changes were observed in nasal cavities, respirator tracts, larynx, and lungs at 18-550mg/m3 on day 9 after the application. Specifically, these changes were degeneration and necrosis of the olfactory epithelium and respiratory epithelium, hyperplasia/squamous metaplasia was detected in the nose and larynx, and hypertrophy/ hyperplasia was detected in the trachea and lungs; and the respiratory system was documented to be a target organ (SIDS (accessed in July 2008)). Since 14-day exposure concentrations were 18-550mg/m3 (90-day correction: 0.003-0.086mg/L) and saturated vapour concentration of the substance was 137mg/m3 (19.7 ppm), it was determined that these symptoms occurred under the mist state with application doses that fall within the range of Category 2 doses. Thus, the substance was classified into Category 2 (respiratory system).</rationale>
