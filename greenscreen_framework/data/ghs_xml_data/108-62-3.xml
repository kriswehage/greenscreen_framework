In a three generation test, fertility, viability and lactation indices were reduced at high dose level (5000 ppm). However, the adverse effects are considered to be observed only at a very high dose level and the information was not used as the basis of classification since hind-limb paralysis and mortality were observed in dams at the high dose level. At lower dose levels, hind-limb paralysis and effects on body weights and liver weights were observed but no effect on reproductive parameters were observed. In developmental toxicity tests by oral administration to rats and rabbits during organogenesis period (A pesticide abstract and evaluation report (Food and Agricultural Materials Inspection Center) (2009)), there were no significant differences in parameters of pregnancy and fetal development in comparison to the control group. No increase in incidence of malformations and variations related to treatment was noted in either species while effects on body weight, food consumption and liver weight were observed. Based on this information, the substance was classified as "Not classified" since there were no adverse effects on parental sexual function and fertility and fetal development.</rationale>

    <rationale>Convulsions (for 3 days), coma (for 7 days) and memory loss were caused in humans following accidental ingestion of metaldehyde (PIMs (1999)). Hunchback position, lethargy and piloerection were observed in rats after an oral administration at dose levels of 100 - 800 mg/kg and sporadic signs included ataxia, whole body tremor and tonic convulsion (A pesticide abstract and evaluation report (Food and Agricultural Materials Inspection Center) (2009)). Additionally, in a mouse oral test, 9/10 and 10/10 mice exhibited tonic flexion and extension convulsion at dose levels of 30 and 100 mg/kg (both within the guidance value range for Category 1), respectively, (A pesticide abstract and evaluation report (Food and Agricultural Materials Inspection Center) (2009)).

    <rationale>In a rat 107-week feeding test, hind-limb paralysis was observed at dose levels of 20 - 100 mg/kg bw/day and lesions of the spinal cord were observed in the top dose (JMPR WHO/FAO Data Sheets on Pesticides No. 93 (1996)). In a dog 52-week feeding test, symptoms such as ataxia, tremors and convulsions as well as histopathological findings such as testicular giant cells, atrophy and degeneration of the germinative epithelium and atrophy of the prostate were observed (A pesticide abstract and evaluation report (Food and Agricultural Materials Inspection Center) (2009)). Since these findings were observed at dos levels within the guidance value range for Category 2, the substance was classified into Category 2 (nervous system, testis). In addition, in a rat 90-day feeding test, liver histopathological changes (centrilobular hepatocyte hypertrophy) were observed in both sexes at 750 and 2500 ppm (approximately 37.5 and 125 mg/kg/day). In a mouse 90-day feeding test, hepatocellular necrosis, hypertrophy, hyperplasia, inflammation, anisokaryosis and vacuolization were observed at 1000 ppm, and the same lesions in minimal degree were observed at 100 and 300 ppm (15 and 45 mg/kg/day) (A pesticide abstract and evaluation report (Food and Agricultural Materials Inspection Center) (2009)). Based on this information, the substance was classified into Category 2 (liver).</rationale>
