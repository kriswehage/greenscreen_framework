    <rationale>The substance is documented to cause moderate to severe irritation in guinea pigs (GESTIS (accessed in November 2008)) and severe irritation in mice (RTECS (2007)). In the case of guinea pigs, it is documented that massive reddening and moderate formation of edema were observed within 24 hours of application, and the symptoms became better in one week; after two weeks there was only still slight reddening but complete hair loss. Based on these documents, the substance was classified into Category 2.</rationale>

    <rationale>Examination of rabbits' eyes after exposure for one hour resulted in slight through to moderate reddening of the lids, nictitating membrane and conjunctiva; after 24 hours there was slight intensification of the reddening and discoloration of the cornea; and after 48 hours moderate reddening, slight edema and injection (of blood vessels) into the iris were observed. 14 days later, changes to the conjunctiva, cornea (opacity) and nictitating membrane were no longer noticeable. The lids were still thickened, sometimes scarred and the surrounding of the eyes was depilated. (GESTIS (accessed in November 2008)). In these observations, since full recovery did not occur 14 days after the application and the substance is labeled with EU Risk Phrase R41 (Risks of serious damage to eyes) (EU-Annex 1 (2008)), the substance was classified into Category 1.</rationale>

In addition, this substance is listed as a sensitizing substance by the German Research Foundation (DFG) (List of MAK and BAT value (2007)). Furthermore, the substance is labeled with EU Risk Phrase R43 (EU-Annex 1 (2008)) and thus, it was classified into Category 1 for skin sensitization.</rationale>

Based on this description, the substance was classified into "Not classified". Also, in 92-day micronucleus tests using peripheral blood of mice that underwent dermal administration, it was documented that normochromatic erythrocytes slightly but significantly increased, yielding weakly positive results (NTP DB (accessed in November 2008)). In vitro tests, including Ames tests and chromosomal aberration tests using cultured cells, yielded negative results (Toxicology Testing Reports of Environmental Chemicals (Chemicals Investigation Promoting Council) accessed in November 2008)).</rationale>

Livers and kidneys of animals which died from administrations of 1000 or 2000 mg/kg (these doses are equivalent to Category 2 guidance values) underwent histopathological examinations; in these examinations, vacuolation of hepatocytes in the peripheral zone of lobules, and necrosis and internal hemorrhage of Glisson's sheath were observed; and in kidneys, the degeneration of the hyaline droplets within the epithelium of the renal tubules was detected. In addition, it is documented that the renal papilla tubules containing hemoglobin casts were detected in animals that retain dark red urine (Toxicology Testing Reports of Environmental Chemicals (Chemicals Investigation Promoting Council) accessed in November 2008).

    <rationale>In 28-day repeated oral administration tests using rats that were applied with doses of 15, 100, or 500 mg/kg/day, death cases were observed in animal groups treated with 500 mg/kg/day (90-day corrected value: 156 mg/kg/day); according to histopathological examinations, necrosis of hepatocytes surrounding the Glisson's sheath was observed, which suggested that the cause of death was liver damage. General symptoms such as decreased spontaneous motor activity, salivation, and inhibited body weight gain were observed, in addition to increased liver weight, swelling of hepatocytes surrounding the Glisson's sheath and acidophilic cytoplasm, and expansion of the duodenum and thickening of mucosa. Discontinuing administration of the substance, histopathological changes in the liver and duodenum disappeared, and other changes also ceased or shifted toward recovery. Regarding histopathological changes seen in duodenum mucosa, irritating property of the test substance is assumed to be the cause (Toxicity Testing Reports of Environmental Chemicals (Chemicals Investigation Promoting Council), accessed in November 2008). Under the condition in which this study was conducted, the NOEL was 100 mg/kg/day (90-day correction value: 31 mg/kg/day) for both sexes (Toxicity Testing Reports of Environmental Chemicals (Chemicals Investigation Promoting Council), accessed in November 2008); and the histopathological changes shown at the doses that were higher than Category 2 guidance values disappeared by discontinuing administration. These observations support that the substances is to be classified into "Not classified" (oral). However, in conclusion, the substance was classified into "Classification not possible" due to lack of data on other administration routes. </rationale>
