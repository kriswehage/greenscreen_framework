Based on these negative results, the substance was classified into "Not classified". Also, in vitro mutagenicity tests (Ames tests and gene mutation tests using V79 or CHO cells) yielded negative results, chromosomal aberration tests using V79 cells yielded weakly positive results, mouse lymphoma assays yielded positive results, and cytogenetic assays using human lymphocytes yielded positive results (JMPR (2002)).</rationale>

    <rationale>Two-year oral route exposure tests, in which rats or mice were fed with a diet containing the substance, were conducted twice for each animal species. In these tests, dose-dependent mortality rates were not detected although reduced body-weight gain was observed (JMPR (2002)). In one of the rat tests, only malignant uterine tumours appeared at higher incidence in all treated groups as compared with controls. Because these tumors develop under normal circumstances, it is reported that the difference observed was likely to be attributed to low incidences of tumor development in control groups (JMPR (2002)). In the other rat test, thyroid follicular-cell adenomas were observed in animals treated with the highest dose (7500 ppm). The probable cause of adenoma was related to the increased concentrations of the thyroid stimulating hormone and alterations in the thyroid feedback mechanism, so the concentration levels that do not affect the thyroid gland would not induce carcinogenicity in humans (JMPR (2002)). With regard to mice, hepatocellular adenomas and pulmonary adenomas were observed in both treated and control groups, and incidences of tumor development due to exposure to the substance did not increase in either mouse tests (JMPR (2002)). Thus, since the rat and mouse tests conducted twice did not show evidence of carcinogenicity, the substance was classified into "Not classified".</rationale>

In addition, in rats and rabbits that underwent oral route exposure during the organogenetic period, no effects on the development of offspring were observed (JMPR (2002)). Based on these negative results, the substance was classified into "Not classified".</rationale>

    <rationale>Its rat LC50 via single inhalation exposure (dust) is 0.16-0.20 mg/kg. The symptoms of exposure include not only morphological changes in the respiratory tracts observed in dead rats, but also extreme difficulties in breathing, respiratory sounds and sneezing, serous nasal discharge, and cyanosis after exposure (JMPR (2002)). Based on these results, the substance was classified into Category 1 (respiratory system).
On the other hand, a test was conducted in which rats underwent single oral administration with doses up to 2000 mg/kg, with neurotoxicological studies being its main purpose. In this test, other than symptoms of reversible general toxicity being detected, no specific neurotoxicity appeared and the effect of exposure was not observed from the histopathological standpoint (JMPR (2002)). In addition, single oral administration tests, in which rats or rabbits were applied with 500 mg/kg, concluded that severe toxic effects were not detected in both animal species (JMPR (2002)).

    <rationale>Rats that underwent inhalation exposure for four weeks exhibited labored breathing and abnormal respiratory sounds, as well as resulting in death cases at 0.05 mg/L/6hr (90-day conversion value: 0.015 mg/L/6hr). In addition, in terms of histopathology, the following were observed: squamous metaplasia and hyperkeratosis of the anterior nasal cavities, squamous metaplasia of the larynx, epithelial desquamation and round-cell infiltration of the trachea, and fibrosis around the bronchia and in lungs. In some cases, these symptoms were detected at the doses of 0.01-0.004 mg/L (90-day conversion values: 0.003-0.001 mg/L) (JMPR (2002)). All of these effects on the respiratory system developed with the doses equivalent to the Category 1 guidance values, so the substance was classified into Category 1 (respiratory system).
On the other hand, serious toxic effects were not recognized with doses that fall under the range of guidance values in the following tests: four oral route exposure tests in which rats were administered with a diet containing the substance for 3 months, 13 weeks, 2 years, or 105 weeks; one test in which dogs were fed with a diet containing the substance for 92 days; two tests in which dogs were orally administered with a capsule containing the substance for 52 weeks; and a test in which mice were administered with a diet containing the substance for 105 weeks (JMPR (2002)). Furthermore, in 3-month, 13-week, and 2-year rat tests, serious toxic effects were not detected with administration doses that were higher than the upper limit of the guidance values (JMPR (2002)). As additional information, in tests in which mice were administered with doses that were higher than the range of guidance values for 105 weeks, the following were observed: the basophilic intranuclear inclusion bodies and lymphohistiocytosis in the liver, and vacuolization of the tubular epithelium in the kidney (JMPR (2002)).
In addition, in rabbits that underwent dermal exposure for 3 weeks, no systemic toxicity was reported (except on the skin where application was made) even in the highest dose groups exposed to 300 mg/kg/day (90-day correction value: approximately 70 mg/kg/day) (JMPR (2002)); however, these results alone are insufficient for classification purposes.
