In addition, there are descriptions that "frostbite and corrosivity. Skin burns and pain." as primary disaster/acute manifestation when liquid chlorine touches the skin (ICSC (J), (2000)) and that liquid chlorine causes chilblain and a burn (HSDB (2005)), contacting liquefied chlorine needs special care.

    <rationale>In mouse, rabbit, and dog, in the equivalent dose to the amount of exposure of guidance value of Category 1, respiratory disorders, such as pulmonary edema, haemorrhage lung, decrease of lung function, bronchitis, and tract epithelium necrosis, are observed. The similar disorders are observed also in rat with no descritption of dosage (EHC 21 (1982)). Moreover, in mouse, cat, rabbit and guinea pig, there are also the descriptions of the inflammation of respiratory tract membrane, choking, breathing-rate reduction, and upper respiratory tract irritation (EHC 21 (1982), ACGIH (2005), PATTY (5th, 2001)). Also in humans, disorder or irritation to respiratory system, such as pneumonia, pulmonary edema, bronchitis, tracheal ulcer, decrease of lung function, asthma and asthmatic symptoms (RADS), irritation to throat or nose, cough, and breathing difficulties are described (EHC 21 (1982), ACGIH (2005), PATTY (5th, 2001)). It was classified into Category 1 (respiratory systems) based on these information. It was classified into Category 1 (nerve systems) based on the description that it causes vomiting, headache, sense of uneasiness, syncope, fatigue, etc. and also causes photosensitivity enhancement and direct effect to the cerebral cortex in humans (EHC 21 (1982), PATTY (5th, 2001)).</rationale>

    <hazard_statement>Causes damage to organs (respiratory organs, kidneys, Olfactory organ) through prolonged or repeated exposure; May cause damage to organs (tooth) through prolonged or repeated exposure</hazard_statement>
    <rationale>There are a publication that a disorder is done to lungs with the dosage of guidance value range of  the Category 1 in an inhalation experiment of a rat and a mouse, and a publication (EHC 21 (1982), PATTY (5th, 2001), IUCLID (2000)) that the airway epithelium inflammation and histologic changes were seen. A potential of causing a bronchus disease and pulmonary hemorrhage in humans is pointed out (EHC 21 (1982)), and the views on a cough, the pain of a throat, coughing up of blood,chest pains, etc. are indicated (ACGIH (2005)). Moreover, there is also statements that there are fears of lung permanent failure and a chronic bronchitis (HSDFS (1998), SITTIG (4th, 2002)). It was classified in Category 1 (respiratory systems) based on these information. It was classified in Category 1 (kidney) based on the statement (PATTY (5th, 2001)) that biochemical changes which indicates the effects on kidney function was seen with the dosage of guidance value range of Category 1 in the rat inhalation experiments. It was classified in Category 1 (olfactus organ) and Category 2 (tooth), based on descriptions in EHC 21 (1982) and PATTY (5th, 2001) that dysosmia was caused in humans, and descriptions in HSDFS (1998) and SITTIG (4th, 2002) that a disorder is done to a tooth. In addition, although there was a publication (IRIS (2002)) that the dosage of guidance value range of Category 2 indicated 10%-20% of underweight in oral administration to mice and rats as compared with the control, it was considered the secondary effects under influence on a respiratory-organs system or the kidney.</rationale>
