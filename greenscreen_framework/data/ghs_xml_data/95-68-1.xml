Although it seemed to correspond to UN GHS Skin irritation Category 3 based on the above-mentioned, it was classified into "Not classified", because Category 3 is not domestically adopted. In addition, there is a description, "It stimulates the skin.........causes reddening, when contacting the skin" in the section of Effects on Humans of the MOE Risk Assessment Vol 6 (2008).

All these symptoms were seen within the range of the guidance value of Category 1. Although there is no data of this substance on the humans, the report that "2,6-xylidine, which is an isomer, caused methemoglobinemia on humans." is described in DFGOT vol.19 (1998). As mentioned above, it was classified into Category 1 (blood systems). In addition, in ICSC (2007), "The high concentration exposure may cause lowering of consciousness.

About the effects on the liver, from description in ACGIH (7th, 2001) that "hepatocellular necrosis and bile duct hyperplasia were observed in male rats" within the limits of the guidance value of Category 2, they are adopted to categorize. Since an increase in hyaline droplet on the epithelium of kidney tubules of kidney was only observed in male rats, it is not adopted to categorize.
