    <rationale>It was classified into "Not classified" because of "not irritating" (IUCLID (2000)) in a 4-hour skin irritation/corrosion test to human (OECD TG 404, GLP). In addition, although there has been a description of "highly irritating" (IUCLID (2000)) in the Draize test with rabbits, it has been described in the primary literature (J. Soc. Cosmet. Chem. 28 (1977)) that the test was a 24-hour test and "the degree of irritation declines in order of rabbits, guinea pig, mise, and humans." Moreover, there has been a description of "slight to moderate irritation" (Patty (5th, 2001)) in the 24-hour skin irritation tests employing rabbits and mice.
