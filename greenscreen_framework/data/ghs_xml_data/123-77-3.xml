    <hazard_statement>May cause allergy or asthma symptoms or breathing difficulties if inhaled</hazard_statement>
    <rationale>There is a report of a bronchial challenge test providing reasonable evidence that the work-related asthmatic symptoms were due specifically to this substance (CICADs 16 (1999)). According to this report, the delay in response to this substance challenge, the magnitude of reduction in FEV1 accompanied by an increase in airway hyperreactivity were observed in one individual, but a control individual did not respond under similar conditions. Additionally, multiple incidents showing a relationship between occupational exposure to this substance and asthma or respiratory symptoms were reported (IUCLID (2000)). Based on the above data and information, it was concluded that the key toxic effect of this substance in humans is asthmagenicity (CICADs 16 (1999)). Therefore, the substance was classified into Category 1. As relevant information, in EU classification, the substance is classified into R42 (EU-Annex I (access on July 2009)).</rationale>

    <rationale>Since to the poor quality of the only available animal test data, it is not possible to draw any conclusions (CICADs 16 (1999)). However, since on a report of skin sensitization in a male textile worker wearing foam ear plugs, a patch test was conducted to determine the cause of recurrent dermatitis of the ear which resulted in a positive reaction to this substance (CICADs 16 (1999)). Additionally, case reports indicate that patients with dermatitis exposed to this substance at the work place showed a positive reaction with this substance (IUCLID (2000)). Therefore it is concluded that the substance should be considered as a human skin sensitizer (CICADs 16 (1999)), and the substance was classified into Category 1.</rationale>

No adverse effects on reproductive parameters of parent animals and viability, growth and morphology of offspring were observed ("Toxicity Testing Reports of Environmental Chemicals" (Chemicals Investigation Promoting Council) (2000)).

Additionally, it was reported that no toxicological significant changes were observed at the highest dose of 0.2 mg/L in 13-week inhalation (aerosol) tests with rats and mice (CICADs 16 (1999)). There were no adverse effects by oral administration at 100 - 1000 mg/kg/day for 8 weeks (90-day equivalence: 60 - 600 mg/kg) to rats (JECFA (1967)). The substance corresponds to "Not classified" with oral and inhalation exposure since NOELs or levels without observed adverse effect exceed the upper limit of the guidance value range for Category 2. However, classification was not possible due to lack of dermal exposure data.</rationale>
