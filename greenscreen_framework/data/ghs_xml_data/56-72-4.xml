    <rationale>In the 2-generation rat studies, while inhibition of cholinesterase activity was detected, no adverse effects on sexual function, fertility, or development of the offspring were observed (ACGIH (2007); PATTY, 5th (2001)). Similarly, in tests using rats and rabbits during the gestation period, no adverse effects were detected. On the other hand, miscarriages were observed in rabbits when doses lethal to parental animals were administered (ACGIH (2007); PATTY, 5th (2001)). Also, in mice, when doses that severely decreased survival rates of parental animals were administered, a decreased number of pregnancies, decreased litter size, and shortened longevity of the offspring were observed. In other words, these adverse effects observed were associated only with high doses that cause mortality in maternal animals, and thus, they were not considered to be the rational for classification. In conclusion, because reproductive and developmental toxicity was not observed in rats, rabbits, or mice, the substance was classified into "Not classified".</rationale>

    <rationale>Cases of exposure to humans, such as nausea, vomiting, stomachache, sweating, urination, miosis, bronchorrhea, and hypersalivation (ACGIH (2007); PATTY, 5th (2001)), have been reported to be typical symptoms of organophosphate poisoning. Similarly, ICSC and ICSC(J) list convulsions, dizziness, sweating, labored breathing, nausea, unconsciousness, pupillary constriction, muscle cramp, excessive salivation, abdominal cramps, diarrhea, and vomiting, as acute symptoms. 
In rats, the following have been observed: cholinergic toxicity, delayed neurotoxicity, diarrhea, and decrease in erythrocytes, blood plasma, and cholinesterase activities in the brain. These effects fit Category 1 based on its guidance values (ingestion of &lt;= 250mg/kg in rats).
Since the substance induces toxicological symptoms in humans and test animals, and due to its mode of action, the substance was classified into Category 1 (nervous system).</rationale>

    <rationale>The substance is regarded as cholinesterase inhibitors in humans (ICSC (1997); ICSC(J) (1997)). In rats and dogs, it is documented to cause inhibition of RBC, plasma, the brain, and ocular muscle cholinesterase activity, as well as to induce symptoms of cholinergic toxicity (ACGIH (2007)), and muscle fasciculation and tremors (PATTY, 5th (2001)). These effects on the nervous system were observed at the doses equivalent to the Category 1 guidance values (ingestion of &lt;= 10mg/kg for 90 days or more in rats and dogs).
