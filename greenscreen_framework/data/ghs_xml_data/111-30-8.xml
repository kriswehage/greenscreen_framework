Furthermore, since it is described to be "highly irritating" after 1-hour exposure and "corrosive" after 4-hour exposure in another study (DFGOT vol.8 (1997)), it was classified as Category 1A-1C. In addition, there are a large number of reports on skin irritations and dermatitis from occupational exposure on humans, especially among hospital related persons (NICNAS (1994)).</rationale>

Moreover, in another study, corneal opacity got worse three days afterward (NICNAS (1994)). It was set as Category 1 based on these statement. In addition, the example of exposure by the accident which was accepted conjunctiva inflammation, a palpebral edema, heliophobe, etc. by humans is reported (ACGIH (2001)).</rationale>

    <hazard_statement>(Respiratory sensitization)May cause allegy or asthma symptoms pr breathing difficulties if inhaled; (Skin sensitization)May cause allergic skin reaction</hazard_statement>
    <rationale>[Respiratory sensitization] There are several reports that humans showed rhinitis, asthma with breathing difficulties, or asthma-like symptoms exposed by this substance (NICNAS (1994)) and a report that concludes that this product caused an occupational asthma based on a bronchial hypersensitive test (ACGIH (2001)). Moreover, the Japan Society for Occupational Health (JSOH advice (2005)) and the Japanese Occupational and Environmental Allergology Society (ALGY society, list of (sensitizing) substances (proposal), p95) listed this as a respiratory tract sensitizer and a sensitizing chemical substance, respectively. Therefore, we classified this as Category 1. In addition, animal testing cannot confirm positive findings (NICNAS (1994)).
[Skin sensitization] There are several reports that health care workers, especially in hospitals and clinics, develop contact dermatitis and that positive reactions are confirmed by patch tests and all are believed to be allergic reactions (NICNAS (1994), DFGOT vol.8 (1997)). In addition, every skin sensitization test with various kinds of methods using guinea pigs, i.e. "Maximization test", "modified Magnusson-Kligman test" and "Buehler test" resulted positive (NICNAS (1994), ECETOCTR77 (1999)). Skin sensitization was classified into Category 1 based on the above information.</rationale>

Furthermore, since although weight loss was observed in mother animal and the born child, the adverse effects on reproduction in two-generation administration to rats were not observed (NTP TR490 (1999)), it was out of the Category.

    <hazard_statement>Cause damage to organs (central nervous system); May cause respiratory irritation or may cause drowsiness and dizziness (respiratory tract irritation)</hazard_statement>
    <rationale>The substance was classified as Category 1 (central nervous system). Because central symptoms, such as inertia, delay in righting reflex and decrease of motor ability, were observed after a single oral exposure of 50 - 200mg/kg or inhalation exposure (fumes) of 10.6 - 42.7ppm in rats (NICNAS (1994)).
The substance was classified as Category 3 (airway irritant). Because there is a report of an human epidemiological study indicating a clear relationship between irritation of the upper airway and occupational (hospital) environmental concentration (DFGOT vol.8(1997)), and there are reports of symptoms associated with airway irritation, such as low respiratory rate and coagulation of original squamous epithelium as the results from inhalation tests in rats and mice (NICNAS (1994), ACGIH (2001), DFGOT vol.8 (1997)).</rationale>

    <rationale>In the test which carried out inhalation exposure to rat and mouse for 13 weeks, pathological changes, such as a necrosis and inflammation in the respiratory tract(the nose, the larynx and tracheal gill) are observed(NTP TR490 (1999)). Moreover, change of the upper airways, such as vestibular neutrophilic infiltrate, destruction and fusion of turbinate are observed in another similar test, but histologic changes are not observed in any parts other than respiratory tract (ACGIH (2001)). These change was observed at 0.5-1ppm, since there are fatal cases it is considered as significant toxic changes, and it was classified into Category 1 (respiratory tract) as compared with the guidance value. In addition, such effect on the respiratory tract is not observed in oral administration (NICNAS (1994)).</rationale>
