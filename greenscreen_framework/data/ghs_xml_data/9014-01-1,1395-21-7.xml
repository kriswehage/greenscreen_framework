In a test of Savinase, a subtilisin enzyme, although it was reported that the PII was 2.6 (HERA (2007)), this result was not used as the basis of classification since the PII was considered not to be significantly different from that in the vehicle control (PII: 2.9).</rationale>

    <rationale>Negative results were obtained from guinea pig skin sensitizing tests (maximization test and Buehler test) (Evaluation of effect for the food safety (Food Safety Commission) (2006), HERA (2007)). In extensive patch testing in human volunteers, exposed workers or users showed no evidence for the ability of subtilisin to induce skin sensitization (HERA (2007)). Overall, the weight of human evidence indicates that subtilisins should not be regarded as skin sensitizers (HERA (2007)). In a survey of 121 workers exposed to subtilisin dusts, skin patch tests showed that sensitization was higher among atopic individuals (64%, 16/25) than among worker considered normally sensitive (33%, 32/96) (ACGIH (2001)). There is a report that although three of the patients who engaged in the preparation of the enzyme and had respiratory illness showed positive skin test (ACGIH (2001)), the details are not clear. Since the substance is not classified as SEN by ACGIH, it cannot be classified based on the results of human patch tests only. It is questionable to classify this substance as "Not classified" based on the above negative results in animal tests (Evaluation of effect for the food safety (Food Safety Commission) (2006), HERA (2007)), therefore, classification was not possible.</rationale>

    <rationale>In a test where Esperase was administered by gavage to rats on gestation days 6 - 18 (organogenesis period) (OECD TG414 (GLP)), no teratogenicity was observed (HERA (2007)). In a test (OECD TG414) where Alcalase (36 - 240 mg aep/kg/day) was administered by gavage to CD rats on gestation day 2, no effects on the body weight gains of the dams or the fetuses were observed and there was no evidence of developmental toxicity (HERA (2007)). In another test (OECD TG414) where Alcalase (54 - 540 mg aep/kg/day) was administered by gavage to CD rats on gestation day 1, general toxicity to the dams was demonstrated by one death at 540 mg aep/kg, and dose-related clinical signs of stress, reduction in body weight gain and food consumption. A slight degree of retardation of skull ossification was observed but there was no evidence of teratogenic effects (HERA (2007)). Based on the data, subtilisins are considered not to produce developmental effects. Classification was not possible since there are no data for effects on sexual function and fertility. There is a report that "a potential of Subtilisin for reproductive and/or developmental toxicity is not expected" based on the following reasons; as proteins, enzymes are readily biodegraded in the gastrointestinal tract; due to their large molecular weight, enzymes do not readily penetrate the skin or mucous membranes to attain consequential concentration in the systemic circulation; and enzymes are not structurally related to any known endocrine disrupter (HERA (2007)).</rationale>
