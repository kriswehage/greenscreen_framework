Among in vitro tests, Ames tests and chromosomal aberration tests using CHO cells yielded negative results (NTP (database) (accessed July 2008)), while mutation tests using mouse lymphoma L5178Y cells yielded positive results (NTP (database) (accessed July 2008)).</rationale>

    <rationale>In carcinogenicity tests using rats and mice that underwent oral exposure for 2 years, high doses were associated with decreased body weight. There was no significant difference in survival rates among different doses tested including control, and exposure of both animal species to the substance did not increase the frequency of tumorigenesis (NTP TR353 (1989)). Since no evidence of carcinogenicity was detected (NTP TR353 (1989), the substance was classified into "Not classified". IARC documented that exposure to polychlorinated phenol complex or its sodium salts may have carcinogenic effects on humans and the complex was classified into Group 2B. However, there was no evidence that this substance itself is carcinogenic in animal tests (IARC 71 (1999)).</rationale>

    <rationale>In reproductive studies, female rats that were administered for 90 days with the substance mixed in water were mated with non-treated males, and mated females were continued to be administered until parturition. At high doses, decreased litter size was observed, but it was not clear if this reduction was resulted from secondary effects of maternal toxicity (IARC 71 (1999)). In addition, it was implied that the substance did not directly affect fecundity (NTP TR353 (1989)). Similar results were obtained after mice of both sexes were administered for 90 days with the substance mixed in water, mated, and continued to be administered through the gestational period: there were no effects on fertility, and fetal toxicity was not observed (IUCLID (2000)). From these 2 documents, it was concluded that the substance has no adverse effects on reproductive functions and fertility. Furthermore, developmental toxicity tests were conducted in which rats were orally administered during the organogenetic period. Decreased body weight of maternal animals occurred at all doses tested, and delayed ossification and mortality of early embryos were observed (IARC 71 (1999)). However, these adverse effects were associated only with high doses that caused mortality of parental animals, and thus do not provide grounds for classification. No adverse effects on the offspring were detected. Overall, since no adverse effects were recognized on reproductive functions, fertility, and development of the offspring, the substance was classified into "Not classified".</rationale>

    <rationale>In oral route acute toxicity tests using mice (similar to OECD guidelines 401), the LD50 values were 1276-1352mg/kg (that are equivalent to Category 2 guidance values), and the central nervous system disorder was observed with symptoms such as ataxia, loss of righting reflex, slight tremors, and salivation detected (IUCLID (2000)). In addition, in dermal route acute toxicity tests using rats (OECD guidelines 402), marked decrease in motor activity and respiratory impairment were observed at 300mg/kg or higher that are equivalent to the Category 1 guidance values, and these symptoms continued after 9 days (IUCLID (2000)). Based on these results, the substance was classified into Category 1 (central nervous system). Moreover, inhalation exposure tests using rats (similar to OECD guidelines 403) resulted in irritation of the eyes and nasal mucosa at nonlethal doses, and these symptoms disappeared within 24 hours (IUCLID (2000)). From these results, the substance was classified into Category 3 (respiratory tract irritation).</rationale>

    <rationale>In 13-week repeated oral administration tests using rats and mice, no significant toxic effects were observed at 5000 ppm (500mg/kg/day) or lower doses; at 10000 ppm (1000mg/kg/day) or higher doses, bone marrow atrophy was observed (NTP TR353 (1989)). In mice, increased frequencies of hepatic necrosis were observed only in males in a dose-dependent fashion. However, lesions were insignificant at 2500-10000 ppm (400-1300mg/kg/day) (NTP TR353 (1989)). From these results, administration doses within the range of guidance values are thought to be not linked to severe toxicity. In 2-year repeated oral exposure tests, no serious changes were observed in rats treated at 120-440mg/kg/day and in mice treated at 430-1300mg/kg/day (NTP TR353 (1989)). In addition, in 6-month and 90-day exposure tests using mice, serious toxic effects were not observed at 230mg/kg/day (6-month tests) and at 40-491mg/kg/day (90-day tests) (NTP TR353 (1989)). No serious toxic effects detected in above 6 tests, using administration doses within the range of guidance values, suggest the classification of the substance into the "Not classified" category (oral route). However, because no data on other routes were available, the substance was classified into "Classification not possible".</rationale>
