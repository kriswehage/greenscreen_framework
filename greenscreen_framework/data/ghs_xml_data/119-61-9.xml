No effect was found among male and female child animals on the number of child-birth, survival capability, anogenital distances"at the dose level where suppression of the body weight increase with mother animals was observed, in the 2 generation repetitive oral administration study with rats" (HSDB (2007). Moreover, there is a description as follows in the repetitive oral administration study with rats of 6-29 day pregnancy, "Although dose dependent reduction in the average body weight of fetuses per 1 litter was observed, no change was found in the pre-birth survival rate, fetal deformation or mutation. Although dose dependent death of mother animals, premature birth and miscarriage were found, there were administration mistakes and deviations in animal species in these dose groups" (NTP DB (Access on September 2008). Therefore, premature birth and miscarriage recognized at the dose level where death among mother animals was recognized in the study using rabbits were not adopted for the decision making due to the possibility of secondary effects and it was classified into "Not classified", judged from other study results. </rationale>
