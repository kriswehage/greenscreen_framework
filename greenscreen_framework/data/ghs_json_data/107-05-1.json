            "hazard_statement": "Causes damage to organs (respiratory system, nervous system, kidney, liver, heart)\nMay cause drowsiness or dizziness (narcotic effects)",
            "rationale": "\"Respiratory tract irritation\" and \"unconsciousness\" are reported in humans exposed to the substance (Initial Risk Assessment Report (NITE, CERI, NEDO) (2008)). In animals, histological changes in the kidney (cloudy swelling of convoluted tubules, degeneration, focal necrosis of podocyte) and liver (dilatation of sinusoid and cloudy swelling of hepatocyte), degeneration of cardiomyocyte and symptoms of nervous system (decreased activity, lethargy, paralysis of hind limbs, tremor and convulsion) are reported at 100 mg/kg following oral exposure in rats (Initial Risk Assessment Report (NITE, CERI, NEDO) (2008)). In inhalation tests with rats and mice, pulmonary oedema and congestion of the liver and kidneys were observed at dose levels of 3.506 mg/L, 8.2 mg/L (rat), and 3.13 mg/L (mouse) (DFGOT vol. 18 (2002)). In inhalation tests with rats and guinea pigs, marked injury to the lungs and kidneys were reported (PATTY (5th, 2001)). Based on these data, the respiratory system, nervous system, kidney and liver were regarded as target organs. The substance appeared to also have a narcotic effect. Additionally, the effects in animals were observed at dose levels within the guidance value range for Category 1. The substance was classified into Category 1 (respiratory system, nervous system, kidney, liver, heart) and Category 3 (narcotic effects).",
