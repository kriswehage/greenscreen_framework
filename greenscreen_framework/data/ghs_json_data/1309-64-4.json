On the other hand, in the public comment literature (LPT (2005)), it is clearly specified as \"non-irritating\" from the test result employing a rabbit of the GLP test organization according to the OECD test guidelines. That is, there exists each one case of positive and negative in the test employing a rabbit. According to the public comments, the literature of LPT (2005) is not open to the public. But it was available through common routes and was used for our reference. The former study with the positive result was performed in 1972, and the details in description of the substance used and the symptoms are unknown. On the other hand, the latter study with the negative result was performed in conformity with the the OECD Test Guideline, 2002, and the details in the origin and description of the substance and symptoms generated are described. Therefore, it may be considered that the latter study with the negative result is more reliable than the former one.
