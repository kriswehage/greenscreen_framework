Males showed no abnormalities in liver enzymes, but increases in relative kidney weight (0.69 vs 0.64 (control), p < 0.01) and relative liver weight. These results suggested effects of inhalation exposure on the liver and the kidneys, but it is described that the significance of the changes in liver enzymes is unclear, since decreases were observed in 3/4 of the enzymes and an increase was observed in only one of the enzyme, and no histopathological lesions were found in the liver or the kidneys, and therefore, the substance was classified into \"Classification not possible\". As relevant information, it is described that the increase in relative kidney weight in males in the intermediate-dose group was not biologically significant, and that the increase in relative liver weight in females appears to be adaptive."

The effects were resolved between 2 to 7 days. 3 rabbits showed necrosis at the application site between Days 1 and 7, desquamation was found in 4 animals on Day 7 (SIDS (access on Aug. 2008)). The results indicated that the erythema, edema and necrosis which developed following application showed recovery or a trend of recovery within 7 days. Based on the data, the substance was classified into Category 2. In another rabbit test, there is a result of \"not irritating\" (SIDS (access on Aug. 2008)).
