            "rationale": "As for animals, in the dietary administration study in rats, \"a statistically significant increase in liver and kidney weight, vacuolation in liver and aggregated basophilia in the histopathological examination, smaller follicle in thyroid, thicker epithelial cells and less colloid density were seen, and the liver, kidney and thyroid were the target organs\" (EU-RAR (2003)). Also in the other dietary administration study in rats, \"a statistically significant increase in liver and kidney weight, and in male rats, pathological change, such as extension of the kidney tubule and hyaline droplet in the kidney, and centrilobular hypertrophy of hepatocytes were caused\" (EU-RAR (2003)). Moreover, in the forced oral administration study in rats, \"an increase in adrenal gland weight and moderate vacuolization in the fascicular zone\" were observed (IRIS (1991)). And in the dermal administration test to rabbits (30% of 1,2,3-trichlorobenzene is included in the test article in addition to the substance), \"a dose-dependent decrease (a significant decrease in the high-dose group) in red blood count, in hemoglobin value and in hematocrit in female rats\" were seen (EU-RAR (2003)). In the inhalation exposure test to rabbits, \"there was a statistically significant increase in testis weight. No pathological changes were seen\" (EU-RAR (2003)). All the above symptoms were seen within the limits of guidance value of Category 2. Since the effects on adrenal gland and testis are not considered to be serious, they are not adopted to categorize. As for human, there are the description that \"it may cause hepatotoxicity when exposed to high concentration of Trichlorobenzene\" (ACGIH (7th, 2001)) and the case report that \"a woman who was exposed to Trichlorobenzene for a long period through her clothing soaked in the substance developed aplastic anemia\" (EHC 128 (1991)), however the type of isomer is not identified in either case and the details are unknown. Therefore, it is classified into Category 2 (liver, kidney, thyroid, blood systems). ",
