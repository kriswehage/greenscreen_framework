According to EHC 224 (2001) on arsenic and its inorganic compounds in relation to humans, gastrointestinal tract disorder; nervous disorder; effects on the blood system; and abnormalities in cardiovascular system, kidney, and liver were observed. Thus, target organs for these substances are the gastrointestinal tract, heart, brain, and kidney. In addition, the skin, bone marrow and peripheral nervous system are also affected by these substances. Moreover, according to ACGIH (2001), the upper respiratory tract and lung are also affected. Based on these reports, this substance was classified into Category 1 (digestive system, circulatory system, nervous system, kidney, liver, blood system, respiratory system, and skin).\nAccording to the manual for handling poisonous and hazardous substances (Jiji Press, latest version, 2001), the substance starts decomposing at -25degC; so the substance is presumably in an unstable state at room temperature.\nSee arsenic trichloride (CAS 7784-34-1, ID 20A2342) and chlorine (CAS 7782-50-5, Japanese government's classification ID 570), which are byproducts of the decomposition of arsenic pentachloride.",

In humans, the following acute toxic effects by arsenic compounds are documented: symptoms of the gastrointestinal tract, cardiovascular system, nerves, and blood system; conjunctivitis and dermatitis as well as irritation to the nasal mucosa, pharynx, and trachea; frequent urination or anuria due to a blockage of renal tubules with clots of hemoglobin (IARC 23 (1980)); depression of bone marrow functions; and hepatomegaly (EHC 224 (2001)). In accordance with these reports, the digestive system, circulatory system, nervous system, blood system, respiratory system, skin, kidney, and liver were considered to be target organs of these compounds, and this substance was classified into Category 1 (digestive system, circulatory system, nervous system, blood system, respiratory system, skin, kidney, and liver).\nAccording to the manual for handling poisonous and hazardous substances (Jiji Press, latest version, 2001), the substance starts decomposing at -25degC; so the substance is presumably in an unstable state at room temperature.\nSee arsenic trichloride (CAS 7784-34-1, ID 20A2342) and chlorine (CAS 7782-50-5, Japanese government's classification ID 570), which are byproducts of the decomposition of arsenic pentachloride.",
