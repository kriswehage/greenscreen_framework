In addition, inhibition of brain cholinesterase was detected at the dose of 80 ppm or more, and this symptom did not improve after 4 weeks (JMPR (1992)). Furthermore, in other tests using rats, mice or dogs (JMPR (1992)), similar cholinesterase inhibition was reported. Thus, the substance was classified into Category 1 (nervous system).
