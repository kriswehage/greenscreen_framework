In an accidental spill from a truck carrying containers of ethyldichlorosilane, 12 exposed patients reported a burning sensation in their throats and eyes, skin irritation, malaise, dizziness, headache, and dyspnea or wheezing (HSDB (2003)). The substance corresponds to Category 1 (respiratory system). However, the substance was classified into Category 2 (respiratory system) due to the information in a document in List 2. Oral exposure can cause pain and difficulty in swallowing, is corrosive to the oral cavity, throat and esophagus, and may also cause epigastric pain associated with nausea and vomiting, intense thirst, and may induce circulatory collapse and circulatory shock which frequently cause death. In addition, tissue contact can cause ulceration, and often perforation can occur resulting in peritonitis and mediastinitis. It is reported that circulatory collapse can occur within several hour and then may progress to renal failure (HSDB (2003)). Based on above information, the substance is considered to mainly cause effects by site of contact due to strong irritation or corrosively, however, the affected organ cannot be identified with oral and dermal routes and the information are reported in a document in List 2. Therefore, the substance was classified into Category 2 (systemic toxicity)."
