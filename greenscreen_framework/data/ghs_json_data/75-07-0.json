Likewise, the results of oral administration to female SD rats (multiple exposure to 200mg/kg (3% solution) on the 6th-18th days of pregnancy) suggest adverse effects on the formation of the fetal skeleton (No details and data on the impact on parent animals are available). However, the former are based on intraperitoneal administration and the latter provide no description of the impact on parent animals, etc. - both of which are not worth being taken into account. "
