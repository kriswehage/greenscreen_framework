                "In a rat test with intraperitoneal injection on gestation day 10, 11 or 12, increased fetal resorptions and increased incidences of malformations (syndactyly, hydrocephaly, exencephaly, cataract and etc.) were observed at dose levels at which no toxicity was manifested in parental animals (Hazard Assessment Report (CERI, NITE) No. 61 (2004)). In a mouse developmental toxicity test with intraperitoneal injection, malformations such as exencephaly, polydactyly and pes valgus were observed (Hazard Assessment Report (CERI, NITE) No. 61 (2004)). Although the reproductive toxicity was observed dose-dependently, maternal toxicity was not evaluated appropriately. Intraperitoneal injection is an unconventional exposure route. Because of the inappropriate evaluation of maternal toxicity and the unconventional exposure route employed, there is no adequate report for reproductive and developmental toxicity (Initial Environmental Risk Assessment of Chemicals (Ministry of the Environment) vol. 1 (2002)). The substance was classified into Category 2 since there is insufficient evidence to classify it in Category 1B.",

Likewise, the results of oral administration to female SD rats (multiple exposure to 200mg/kg (3% solution) on the 6th-18th days of pregnancy) suggest adverse effects on the formation of the fetal skeleton (No details and data on the impact on parent animals are available).
