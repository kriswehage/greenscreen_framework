Among these tests, four mixed diet tests using rats (4 weeks, 28 days, 90 days, and 106 weeks) and one mixed diet test using dogs (52 weeks) did not provide any indications of serious toxic effects at the highest doses within the range of guidance values tested, as well as any data useful for the classification of the substance. In the three mixed diet tests using mice (8 weeks, 13 weeks, and 78 weeks), congestion of the lung, cellular depletion of the spleen and lymphoid atrophy, and/or necrosis of the thymus were observed at the doses higher than the upper limit of the guidance value range; no serious toxic effects were observed at the doses that fall under the guidance value range, however. On the other hand, the stomach tube administration test (4 weeks) resulted in occurrence of mortality cases at all doses tested (75, 100, and 200 mg/kg/day (90-day correction values: 23, 31, and 62 mg/kg/day)), and symptoms such as salivation, deteriorating health status, and respiratory distress occurred in a dose-dependent fashion. At the highest dose of 200 mg/kg/day, an increase in BUN, total bilirubin, and GPT; a decrease in glucose, protein, and albumin were observed; in addition, as histopathological symptoms, lesions were observed in the stomach, spleen, thymus, adrenal glands, and intestines. Furthermore, at the doses of 75 or 100 mg/kg/day, edema, mixed-cell infiltration, and hyperplasia of the squamous mucosa of the stomach were detected by gastrointestinal tests. The development of lesions in the stomach is likely to be caused by the irritating property of the test substance, but taking cases of death and other observed effects into account, it is difficult to specify a target organ on which the substance has an impact. Therefore, the substance was classified into Category 2 for systemic toxicity.\nIn the case of dermal exposure, rats that received doses (maximum dose: 200 mg/kg/day (90-day correction: 62 mg/kg/day)) for 3 or 4 weeks did not show notable systemic toxicity as the effect of the test substance, excluding the development of lesions on the skin where the substance was applied (JMPR (2000)).
