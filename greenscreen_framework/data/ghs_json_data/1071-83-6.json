In the other test, a partial ossification (vertebrae and sternebra) and reduction in ossification (manus) were observed in fetuses at the dose (300 mg/kg bw /day) that induces general toxicity in parental animals (reduced food consumption, diarrhea, or suppressed body weight gain).

In teratogenicity tests using rats (complied with the US EPA guidelines or OECD TG 414, GLP), a slight increase in reduced ossification and skeletal variation (wavy ribs) was observed in fetuses at the dose (1000 mg/kg bw /day) that induces general toxicity in parental animals (suppressed body weight gain and respiratory changes) (JMPR, 2004). However, in a different teratogenicity test using rats (OECD TG 414, GLP), no effects were observed in either parental animals or fetuses at the same dose (1000 mg/kg bw / day).

Through dermal route exposure, these signs (reduced activity and sedation) were not detected in either rats or rabbits (JMPR, 2004). Through inhalation exposure in two rat tests, animals were slightly subdued in one test; however, auditory hypoaesthesia and a reduced righting reflex, as well as irregular breathing were observed in the other test (JMPR, 2004). Furthermore, at the administration dose of 4.43 mg/L (4h), dark lungs were detected in cases of death (two of five dead males) (JMPR, 2004). Based on these results, the substance was classified into Category 3 (narcotic effects) in terms of oral and inhalation route exposure.",
