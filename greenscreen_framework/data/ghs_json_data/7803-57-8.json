In addition, stomatitis, tremor, lethargy incoherent speech, jaundice, a tender and palpable liver due to hypertrophy, elevated blood bilirubin and creatinine levels, protein in urine, and severe renal tubule necrosis found in autopsy were detected (IARC (1987)). Based on the list of these effects, we decided target organs of this substance are the liver, nervous system, gastrointestinal tract, and kidney. The gastrointestinal tract was selected as a target organ because it was affected in dermal exposure studies.\nFrom above information, the substance was classified into Category 1 (liver, nervous system, gastrointestinal tract, and kidney).\n\nIn order to make classifications of hydrazine monohydrate, we selected assessment reports clearly stating that tests were conducted on hydrazine monohydrate. However, hydrazine monohydrate is easily formed from hydrazine (ID: 0056, CAS No. 302-01-2) reacting with water. Due to this, when hydrazine is dissolved in water in order to expose animals to hydrazine in animal studies, dissolved hydrazine is thought to be in a state of hydrazine monohydrate. Therefore, see also classifications of hydrazine (ID: 0056, CAS No. 302-01-2) and take them into account for evaluation of hydrazine monohydrate.",

However, hydrazine monohydrate is easily formed when hydrazine (ID: 0056, CAS No.302-01-2) comes in contact with water. Hence, an aqueous solution of hydrazine often used in animal studies is also considered to be \"hydrazine (mono)hydrate.\" Therefore, in evaluating hydrazine monohydrate, it is advised to refer to \"hydrazine\" (ID 0056, CAS No.302-01-2) as well. \n\n"
