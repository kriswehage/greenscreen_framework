Also, no effects on gestational period, litter size or birth rate were observed. On the other hand, inferior nursing behavior by maternal animals was observed immediately after parturition as well as during the nursing period in terms of collecting, lactating, and warming their pups (newborns). These observations suggest that the administration of this substance during the perinatal period may affect parturition and nursing behavior. Increased fetal death rates and accompanying decreased birth rates as a result of inferior nursing behavior by maternal animals were observed. Also, since decreased survival rates of 4-day old neonates, lower body weight of neonates (both sexes) at birth, and decreased body weight gain after 4 days of nursing were observed, effects of the substance on the development of the fetus and offspring during prenatal and nursing periods were indicated (Toxicity Testing Reports of Environmental Chemicals (Chemicals Investigation Promoting Council), accessed in May 2008).
