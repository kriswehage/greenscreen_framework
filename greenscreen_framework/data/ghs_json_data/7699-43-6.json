        "As acute intoxication by oral ingestions in humans, there are descriptions about symptoms relevant to a wide range of organs, including digestive organs, liver, blood, urinary system, nervous system and circulatory system (PATTY (5th, 2001)). Among these symptoms, development of convulsion and gastrointestinal hemorrhage is reported as a serious toxic effect in animals (RTECS (2004)). Therefore we classified it into Category 1 (nervous system, gastrointestinal system, liver, blood, urinary system, circulatory system). In addition, there is description that \"an airway can be stimulated in the process of hydrolysis to hydrochloric acids\" (PATTY (5th, 2001)). Therefore we classified it as Category 3 (respiratory irritant)."
