As for effects on human fetuses, views are conflicting. In animal experiments, excess administration of colecalciferol has been reported to induce skeletal abnormalities in rats, cardiac abnormalities in rabbits, and microcephaly and skeletal abnormalities in mice (Birth Defect (3rd, 2000)). Especially in cases of rabbits, also similar findings to those of aortic valvular stenosis found in human cases have been obtained (HSDB (2006)). As described above, although its reproductive toxicities have been reported, views are conflicting, thus there is lack of information on the substance. Furthermore, as for animal experiments, these reports provide descriptions on inductions of such symptoms as cardiac abnormalities (rabbits, findings similar to those of aortic valvular stenosis), and microcephaly and skeletal abnormalities (mice), but no descriptions on general toxicity in parental animals.
