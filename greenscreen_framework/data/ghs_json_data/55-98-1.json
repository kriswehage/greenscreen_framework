Examination of 21 girls, aged 11 - 21 years, who had earlier received several years of high-dose chemotherapy and autologous bone marrow transplantation, demonstrated that the 10 girls who received the substance all developed severe and persistent ovarian failure (HSDB (2009)). A woman treated with the substance throughout the majority of her pregnancy gave birth to an infant with severe growth retardation, cleft palate, microphthalmia and hypoplastic ovaries. It was concluded that these malformations were caused by the substance (Birth Defects (3rd, 2000)). A case of myeloschisis in a six week old human embryo was reported for a mother treated with the substance before and during the early stages of gestation for leukemia (Birth Defects (3rd, 2000)). Additionally, there is a report of a infant with multiple malformations whose mother was treated with the substance for lukemia during gestation (Birth Defects (3rd, 2000)). The substance is classified into Category D (There is positive evidence of human fetal risk, but potential benefits may warrant use of the drug in pregnant women despite potential risks) from FDA (The Merck Manual (18th, Japanese)). Based on all this information, the substance corresponds to a known human reproductive toxicant and is classified into Category 1A. From animal tests, there is a report that microencephaly and microphthalmia were observed in the embryos/fetuses from rats exposed intraperitoneally during gestation (HSDB (2009)) and a report that the substance is teratogenic in mice, rats and rabbits (EMEA (2005)).",

Since interstitial pneumonitis and pulmonary fibrosis have also been reported in patients receiving high oral doses as a component of a conditioning regimen prior to allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (HSDB (2009)) and nonspecific interstitial fibrosis was diagnosed by lung biopsy in one patient receiving IV administration who subsequently died from respiratory failure (HSDB (2009)), the lung was regarded as a target organ.
