The negative results by oral administration were obtained with the single-dose of 40 mg/kg and with a doubtful methodology, while positive results by IP administration (1 - 3 mg/kg) contained chromatid gaps and their evaluation is difficult. It is documented that a mouse dominant lethal test with intraperitoneal administration (4.5 mg/kg) yielded negative results, a rat dominant lethal test with oral administration (0.15 - 5 mg/kg) showed negative results, and a mouse oral administration test (28 - 80 mg/kg) induced micronuclei, chromosomal aberrations, and abnormal sperm heads. Based on the above results, the effects on germ cells can be denied, but the effects on somatic cells cannot be determined, therefore, the substance was classified into Category 2.
