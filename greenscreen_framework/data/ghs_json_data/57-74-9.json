From epidemiological tests, there is a report that a segment of a municipal water system in TN (USA) was contaminated with chlordane and 71 of 105 residents in affected houses reported contact with contaminated water. 13 of the residents (18%) complained to have mild symptoms (gastro-intestinal and/or neurological) following exposure (IARC 79 (2001)). Neurophysiological and neuropsychological tests were performed on 216 adult occupants of an apartment complex. The exterior of the building had been sprayed with chlordane 7 years earlier. The most notable changes observed in the residents were slowing of reaction time, balance dysfunction, reductions in cognitive function, and deficits of immediate and delayed recall (IRIS (1997)). Based on the information, the substance was classified into Category 1 (nervous system). In a 2-year oral test in mice, degeneration and necrosis in the liver were noted at dose levels of 5 mg/kg and 12.5 mg/kg (IARC 79 (2001)). In a 2-year oral test in rats, hepatocellular alterations consisting of cytoplasmic oxyphilia and hyalinization, karyorrhexis, and cell necrosis were obvious dose-dependent effects at 10 - 300 mg/kg (EHC 34 (1984)). Based on these reports, the substance was classified into Category 1 (liver). Additionally, in epidemiological tests, many cases of chlordane exposure-related hematologic diseases such as aplastic anaemia, leukaemia, hypoplastic anaemia, megaloblastic anaemia, thrombocytopenia and pernicious anaemia were reported (IARC 79 (2001)). Based on these reports, the substance was classified into Category 1 (blood system). Based on all information, the substance was classified into Category 1 (nervous system, liver, blood system).",

Moreover, in investigation of the humans who received prolonged exposure by aerosols, neurophysiological effect is ascertained (IRIS (1997), JMPR 080 (1967)), and there is also a report (IRIS (1997)) of a cerebrovascular disease, anemia and a decrease of platelets by occupational exposure or epidemiological study. It was classified in Category 1(liver,nervous systems, cerebrovascular, blood) based on the above result."

In an oral test by exposure during gestation (until birth), an increase in percent loss of pups per litter was seen (IRIS (2002), ATSDR (1994)). Possible explanations for these findings were direct exposure to chemical through maternal milk, or inability of dam to lactate or care for the pups. In the high-dose group, 55% of the offspring of the dams died within the nursing period. It is possible that exposure to high levels of the test substance and/or metabolites in the dam's milk may were responsible for these deaths (ATSDR (1994)). The offspring of mice orally treated at 2.5 mg/kg exhibited neurobehavioral effects (depressed acquisition of avoidance response and increased exploratory activity etc.). The authors concluded that the substance affected the fetal brain and exposure could also have occurred via nursing (ATSDR (1994)). Because of the decreased viability of pups and the reduced number of mated females are probably effects of prenatal exposure, the substance was classified into Category 2 and \"Effects on or via lactation\".",
