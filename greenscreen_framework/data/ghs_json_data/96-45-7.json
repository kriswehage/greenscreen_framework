Central nervous system and skeletal anomalies and cleft palate were observed at doses at which toxicity in the parents was observed (Initial Risk Assessment Report (NITE, CERI, NEDO) (2008)). In a rabbit oral test (during organogenesis: day 7 - 21 of gestation), an increase in resorptions was seen at doses at which no toxicity in the parents were observed (Initial Risk Assessment Report (NITE, CERI, NEDO) (2008)). In a hamster oral test (during organogenesis: day 6 - 13 of gestation), dose-dependent increased fetal mortality and decreased fetal weight, malformations of the skeleton and lungs, and effects on the central nervous system were observed at doses at which no toxicity in the parents were observed (DFGOT vol. 11 (1998)). Based on the reported information, the substance was classified into Category 1B. As relevant information, the substance is classified into Repr. Category 2; R61 in EU classification.",

There is the existing classifications of EU Annex 1: Repr.Cat.2;R61."
