Based on this information, the substance was classified into Category 1 (heart). In 13-week inhalation tests in rats and mice (0, 0.3, 13, 10 and 30 mg/m3), both rats and mice developed squamous metaplasia of the larynx (>=0.3 mg/m3), chronic inflammation of the larynx, nose and lung (0.3 - 1 mg/m3), and more severe effects at higher exposures (>30 mg/m3) (CICADs 69 (2006)).
