            "rationale": "In acute toxicity tests using rats, muscle cramp, tremors, atactic gait and irregular respiration were observed at the toxic dose (Pesticide Safety Information (Japan Crop Protection Association) (Sumitomo Chemical 1989-II)). Since the LD50 value is 60-164 mg/kg bw, it is presumed that muscle cramp, tremors, atactic gait and irregular respiration occurred at the exposure concentrations which fall under the range of Category 1 guidance values (<= 300 mg/kg bw). Although the substance is to be placed in Category 1 based on the guidance values, it was classified into Category 2 (nervous system) because the results were obtained using List 2 data.",
