Inhalation exposure of pregnant rats to 500 - 1500 ppm during gestation resulted in increased resorptions rates (EHC 122 (1991)). Following inhalation exposure to rats on days 6 - 17 of gestation, the number of live fetuses per litter was significantly reduced at the 5,000 ppm dose level, with a significant concentration dependent trend (ATSDR (1999)).
