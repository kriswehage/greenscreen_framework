In addition, based on a report that irritation (or possibility of irritation) of the throat or upper respiratory tract occurred in humans after inhalation exposure (ACGIH (7th, 2001) and a report that inhalation in mice resulted in irritation of the respiratory tract (PATTY (5th, 2001)), the substance was classified into Category 3 (respiratory tract irritation).",
