And considering that male is 2000mg/kg (purity equivalent of 1172mg/kg), and female is 1000mg/kg (purity equivalent of 586mg/kg) about the amount of non toxic of this test, and the difficulty of specifying the target organs. So it is generally considered as in the guidance value of the Category 2, it is classified into Category 2 (general toxicity). Moreover, in the rat inhalation acute toxicity test, the inflammation of a respiratory way, pharyngitis, and a tracheal gill flame occured. So it is classified into Category 3 (respiratory irritation)."
