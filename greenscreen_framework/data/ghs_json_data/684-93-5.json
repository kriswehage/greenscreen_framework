According to Patty 5th (2001), non-oral administration of this substance at 20 mg/kg to rats was associated with clear cases of teratogenic effects. Furthermore, according to HSDB (2003), in a study in which mice received single intraperitoneal administration of this substance on day 2 of pregnancy, all fetuses died at doses that did not show toxic effects to parental animals\u2014the toxic dose range for fetuses and their development was one order magnitude lower than the toxic dose range for adult animals.
