The effects were observed at dose levels which exceeded the guidance value range. Exposure to the substance by inhalation of a concentration of 8000 ppm for 2-hour (4-hour equivalence: 20.8 mg/L) caused gasping, loss of coordination, and pulmonary edema with death occurring in a period of 2-hour (PATTY (5th, 2001)).

At the 3000 ppm dose, total incidences of fetal malformations were significantly increased and included cleft palate, microtia, and multiple skull bone malformations (HSDB (2003)). Since the effects on reproduction and fetal development, especially the increased incidences of fetal malformations, were observed at a dose level in which general toxicity such as decreased body weight gain in the parental animals was manifested, the substance was classified into Category 2.",

At the dose of 3000 ppm, reduced maternal body weight gain, food consumption as well as increased postimplantation loss due to increased resorption and increased number of stunted fetuses were observed (HSDB (2003)). Furthermore, at the same dose, total incidences of fetal malformations including cleft palate, microtia, and multiple skull bone malformations were significantly increased (HSDB (2003)). As described above, the dose that caused general toxic effects such as reduced body weight gain in parental animals, affected reproduction and fetal development; for instance, incidences of fetal malformation increased, which appeared to be especially significant. Based on these results, the substance was classified into Category 2."
