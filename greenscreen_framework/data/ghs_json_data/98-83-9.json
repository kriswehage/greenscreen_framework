In a 2-year inhalation test in rats, significantly increased incidence of degeneration of the olfactory epithelium (at 1.473 mg/L and higher concentrations) and basal cell hyperplasia (at 0.491 mg/L and higher concentrations) were observed (NTP TR543 (2007)).

Acidophilic change of hepatocytes and increased GPT observed in an oral test (\"Toxicity Testing Reports of Environmental Chemicals\" (Chemicals Investigation Promoting Council) (1996)) are considered to be adaptive changes.

However, two dams of the high dose group completely lost their litters and the viability index on day 4 was slightly decreased (\"Toxicity Testing Reports of Environmental Chemicals\" (Chemicals Investigation Promoting Council) (1996), SIDS (1998)). Since the body weight of surviving offspring increased normally, the death of offspring is likely to be secondary consequence of maternal toxic effects rather than a direct effect on the offspring (\"Toxicity Testing Reports of Environmental Chemicals\" (Chemicals Investigation Promoting Council) (1996)). There were no significant differences in numbers of live offspring at birth, the sex ratio, the numbers of live offspring and viability index after birth. No malformation was observed (SIDS (1998)).
