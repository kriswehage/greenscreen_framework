                "In two-generation reproductive tests by oral exposure to mice and inhalation exposure to rats, lengthened estrous cycles, decreased fertility, reduced pup survival and litter size were observed at the highest dose (3000 ppm) group of rats. However, the result was not used as the basis of classification, since these findings accompanied marked toxicity, as evidenced by persistent sedation and decreased body weights which were as much as 21% lower than the control group. For the other dose level rat and the mice dose groups, there were no effects on sexual function and fertility (SIDS (2001)). In developmental toxicity tests by inhalation exposure to rats and rabbits during organogenesis period (SIDS (2001)) and by oral exposure to rats, mice or rabbits during gestation period (SIDS (2001)), delayed sternebral ossification was observed in some tests but no adverse effects on fetal development including teratogenicity were detected. Since it is clear from appropriate tests with multiple animal species and by multiple exposure routes that the substance has no reproductive or developmental toxicity, it was classified as \"Not classified\".",
