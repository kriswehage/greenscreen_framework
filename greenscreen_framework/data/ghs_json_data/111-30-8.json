At the oral lethal dose level for rodents, the animals showed symptoms of depressive effects to the CNS, cramps and difficulty in breathing (GESTIS (access on April 2009)). Based on these reports, the substance was classified into Category 1 (central nervous system).\nThere are epidemiological reports showing a clear association between upper respiratory tract irritation and occupational exposure concentration (in hospital) (DFGOT vol. 8 (1997)). Additionally, there are reports of airway irritation symptoms such as reduction in the respiration rate and squamous coagulation in rat and mouse inhalation tests (NICNAS (1994), ACGIH (2001), DFGOT vol. 8 (1997)). Based on these reports, the substance was classified into Category 3 (respiratory tract irritation).",
