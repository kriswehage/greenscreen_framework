However, at the lower exposure dose of 60mg/kg/day, neither effects of the substance nor significant changes were observed. Consequently, this data cannot be used as a basis for classification. On the other hand, in 14-day inhalation exposure tests using rats, dose-dependent, histopathological changes were observed in nasal cavities, respirator tracts, larynx, and lungs at 18-550mg/m3 on day 9 after the application. Specifically, these changes were degeneration and necrosis of the olfactory epithelium and respiratory epithelium, hyperplasia/squamous metaplasia was detected in the nose and larynx, and hypertrophy/ hyperplasia was detected in the trachea and lungs; and the respiratory system was documented to be a target organ (SIDS (accessed in July 2008)). Since 14-day exposure concentrations were 18-550mg/m3 (90-day correction: 0.003-0.086mg/L) and saturated vapour concentration of the substance was 137mg/m3 (19.7 ppm), it was determined that these symptoms occurred under the mist state with application doses that fall within the range of Category 2 doses. Thus, the substance was classified into Category 2 (respiratory system)."
