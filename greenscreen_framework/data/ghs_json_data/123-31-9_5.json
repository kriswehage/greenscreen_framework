            "rationale": "About respiratory systems, there is the data from workers who were exposed to the mixture of Hydroquinone, Trimethylhydroquinone, and Retinene-Hydroquinone (EHC). However, within the limits described in SIDS, EHC, Patty's and Hazard Data Collection, there was no data that showed respiratory effects by inhalation exposure to Hydroquinone. Therefore, at the present stage, data is not sufficient for carrying out GHS classification about the repeated exposure on respiratory systems. As for blood system, there is animal test data where \"hematological changes, such as anisocytosis, polychromasia and acidophilic erythroblasts\" were observed within the guidance value ranges of \"Category 1\" (collection of hazard data, EHC). On the other hand, there is a case of human volunteers with no effect on blood (EHC), and this case is adopted in the section of evaluation on the human health risk in EHC. Therefore, although effects on blood system are observed in the study using rats, it can be judged that there is no effect on human blood system and it is considered equivalent to \"Not classified\" on blood system according to GHS classification. As for central nervous system, referring to EHC, the data which has become the rationale for three-minitsry GHS classification was turned out to be the case where \"tremor and decreased activity were observed immediately after administration\". Since this is regarded as the effect due to single exposure, it is considered proper to exclude central nervous system from the target organs for repeated exposure. As for liver, hepatotoxicity is observed in the study using mice within the guidance value ranges of \"Category 2\" and not observed in the study using animals such as rats. Moreover, there is no human case exhibiting hepatotoxicity. However, at present, it is considered proper to be defined as \"Category 2 (liver)\" based on the data on mice. As for kidney, although nephropathy is found in F344 male rats by repeated exposure of this substance, nephropathy is not found in F344 female rats, SD rats, Carworth rats, dogs and mice (Patty's). Moreover, it is indicated in SIDS, EHC, and Patty's that F344 female rats are sensitive to effects on kidney. Therefore, since nephropathy is considered to be a symptom peculiar to F344 male rats, it is considered proper to exclude kidney from the target organs for repeated exposure. From the above, the GHS classification for repetitive exposure is changed from \"Category 1 (respiratory organs, blood system), Category 2 (central nervous system, liver, kidney).\" to \"Category 2 (liver)\".

Therefore, it is thought unreasonable to apply this to the decision of primates (humans) which species is different. Since human cases don't show neither harmful clinical influence nor change of blood and urine, it is judged that removal of kidney is appropriate. ",
