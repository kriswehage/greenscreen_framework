In one of the tests, symptoms of the corneas, irises, and conjunctivas (redness and chemosis) developed in all of the cases in which the eyes were not washed after the application. These symptoms remained unrecoverable 14 days after the application, and were quantified by the maximum mean total Draize score (MMTS) of 105. Yet, in another rabbit test in which the eyes were not washed after the application, severe cases of corneal clouding were observed 1 hour after the exposure and these symptoms continued for 7 days. The average Draize scores were 3.8 for corneas and 2 for irises, and corneal pannus and keratoconus occurred in some of the treated animals. These results revealed that the substance caused serious and irreversible eye damage, and thus it was classified into Category 1. Its pH = 11.58 (5 wt% aqueous sol. at 25degC) (HSDB (2003))."
