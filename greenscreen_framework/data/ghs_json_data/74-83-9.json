In a 13-week inhalation test in rats decreases in hematocrit, hemoglobin and erythrocyte count were observed at 87 ppm, which falls within the guidance value range for Category 2 (50 - 250 ppmV) (Initial Risk Assessment Report (NITE, CERI, NEDO) No. 126 (2008), NTP TR385 (1992)).

In a 3-week inhalation exposure test in rats (Initial Risk Assessment Report (NITE, CERI, NEDO) No. 126 (2008)), degeneration of myocardium, degeneration and necrosis in the testis, lethargy, tremor and paralysis of limbs were observed at 26.7 ppm and higher levels, which falls within the guidance value range for Category 1 (less than 50 ppm).

Based on the data, the substance was classified into Category 1 (heart). In 13 - 25 week oral dose tests (Initial Risk Assessment Report (NITE, CERI, NEDO) No. 126 (2008)), chronic inflammation and fibrillization in the stomach were observed at 36 - 50 mg/kg/day, which fall within the guidance value range for Category 1 (less than 50 ppm), and lymphocytic infiltration in the glandular stomach and chronic inflammation in the esophagus were observed at 50 mg/kg/day. These data were not used for classification, since the effects were attributed to irritation of the substance. Findings of degeneration and necrosis in the testis noted in a 3-week inhalation exposure test in rats correspond to Category 2 of reproductive toxicity, and were not used for this classification.",
