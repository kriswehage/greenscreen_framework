However, since NOAEL is within the range of Category 2 guidance values, toxic effects that may occur at the upper limit of Category 2 guidance values are unclear. In 90-day repeated dermal exposure tests using rabbits, no adverse effects of treatment were noted in clinical chemical examinations as well as hematologic and histopathological examinations other than sporadic observation of mild erythema on the skin at the dose of 500 mg/kg/day; NOAEL was 500 mg/kg/day (SIDS (accessed in November 2008)).
