These findings by oral administration are considered to be local effects caused by a corrosive substance. Additionally, there are reports that inhalation exposures in mice resulted in irritation, excitement, and convulsions (PATTY (5th, 2001)) and that inhalation exposure in rats resulted in irritation, bronchitis, conjunctivitis, and possible liver and kidney injury (HSDB (2008)). From a rat oral LD50 value of 300 mg/kg and an inhalation LC50 value of 1.3 mg/L (PATTY (5th, 2001)), the toxic effects were observed at dose levels within the guidance value range for Category 1.
