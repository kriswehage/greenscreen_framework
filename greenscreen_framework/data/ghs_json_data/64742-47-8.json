However, these test results were based on extracts of test substances, and no positive results were found in any in vitro mutagenicity tests using several indices. Thus, the substance was classified into the \"Classification not possible\" category. As additional information, negative results were obtained in chromosomal aberration tests using bone marrow cells of rats that underwent intraperitoneal administration of kerosene (in vivo mutagenicity tests using somatic cells). However, these results cannot be confirmed as the toxicity on the treated animals or the target organ (bone marrow) was not documented (ATSDR (1995)).
