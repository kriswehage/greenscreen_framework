In a rat inhalation test of barium monohydrate, animals exhibited transient hypoactivity and escape behavior, rubbing of eyes and snout with fore-limbs, bloody exudate from eyes and nose, chemical burns of fore-limbs and snout, diarrhea, and dyspnea during exposure, and also exhibited persisting lethargy, necrosis of fore-limbs, snout and ears, ataxia from loss of hind-limb muscular coordination, self-mutilation and death (LD50: 0.675 mg/L/4h) during recovery (HSDB (2009)). These signs were estimated to occur at dose levels within the guidance value range for Category 2 with oral exposure or Category 1 with inhalation exposure from the LD50 and LC50 values. However, the substance was classified into Category 2 (systemic toxicity) since the information are in documents in List 2 and do not meet Decision criteria 1b 3) and it was reported that mortality was attributed to the corrosive nature of the substance (HSDB (2009))."
