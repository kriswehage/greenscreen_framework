In rats, histological changes in the liver (fatty degeneration, ceroid deposit, bile duct proliferation and increased incidence of liver cirrhosis) were observed at 10 ppm (0.0641 mg/L) and higher levels following 13-weeks of inhalation (vapour) exposure (Hazard Assessment Report (CERI, NITE)). Based on the data, the substance was classified into Category 1 (liver). In the 13-week inhalation (vapour) exposure test reported above, abnormalities in urine parameters was observed at 90 ppm (0.57 mg/L) and higher levels, and renal tubular vacuolization, glomerular hyalinosis and protein cast in the liver were observed at 270 ppm (1.7 mg/L) and higher levels. In addition, progressive glomerulonephropathy is reported at 25 ppm (0.16 mg/L) and higher levels following 2-year inhalation (vapour) exposure (Hazard Assessment Report (CERI, NITE)). Since these findings were noted even at dose levels within the guidance value range for Category 1, the substance was classified into Category 1 (kidney). In 6-week inhalation exposure (vapour) tests in rats, guinea pigs, rabbits, dogs and monkeys, interstitial fibrosis in the liver and pneumonia were observed at 0.515 mg/L (90-day equivalent: 0.28 mg/L/6 h/day) in all species (Initial Environmental Risk Assessment of Chemicals (Ministry of the Environment) vol. 3 (2004)). Since these effects were noted at dose levels within the guidance value range for Category 2, the substance was classified into Category 2 (respiratory tract). In conclusion, the substance was classified into Category 1 (liver, kidney) and Category 2 (respiratory tract). Detailed reports about hematological effects are lacking. There is a report of decreases in hemoglobin concentration, hematocrit and erythrocyte count at 270 ppm (1.7 mg/L) and higher levels in a 13-week inhalation (vapour) exposure test in mice (Hazard Assessment Report (CERI, NITE)), however, the findings were noted at dose levels beyond the guidance value range, therefore the data was not used for classification.",
