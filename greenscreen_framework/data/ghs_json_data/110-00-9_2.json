Referring to the primary literature of RTECS (Toksikologiya Novykh Promyshlennykh Khimicheskikh Veshchestv, 9, 106 (1967), ibid., 10, 35 (1968)), the former tracheal or bronchial abnormalities are accompanied by local lung emphysema under the exposure condition where the rat treated with 2-hr/day inhalation for 30 days of 1.0-1.3mg/L (equivalent to the guidance value of Category 1), but the latter symptoms of central nervous system are considered to have been seen in the study to obtain the lethal dose (LC50) and there was no description of functional disorder of central nerve in the subacute and chronic toxicity studies.
