However,  as toxicity of the inorganic lead compounds, besides the inhibition of hemoglobin synthesis induced to humans by delta-aminolevulinic acid and heme synthase inhibition, anemia caused by the shortening of red cell life span, interstitial disorders, the reduction of urinary output, the proximal tubule damages which cause the Fanconi syndromes represented by alubuminuria, bloody urine, urine pillars, glucosuria and amino acid urine, etc. are observed. As they act on the peripheral nerves, especially weakness of the line of the limbs, pain, and convulsion are identified, and as their influences on the central nerve systems such as ataxie, headach, abnormal sebsation, depression, and coma are identified with high concentration exposures. These influences are acute ones   "
