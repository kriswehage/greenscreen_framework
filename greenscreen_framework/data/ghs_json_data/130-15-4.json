In a rat 6-month inhalation (dust) test (4-hour/day), the findings of hepatic dysfunction such as positive thymol test, decreased glycogen level and degeneration of hepatic parenchyma cell were observed at concentrations of 0.7 mg/m3/4 hr (0.0005 mg/L/6 hr) and higher (BUA 211 (1998)).

Although changes in hematological parameters including formation of methemoglobin and central nervous system disorder were observed in a rat 30-day oral test (BUA 211 (1998)), this information is not used as the basis of classification since data for the protocol and results are insufficient and there is a comment that this test is inadequate to evaluate systemic effects (BUA 211 (1998))."

Additionally, respiratory tract irritation for human was reported and it was concluded that the substance caused severe irritation to the upper respiratory tract. Irritating lesions in the lung were observed in a mouse inhalation test based on decreased respiratory rate without histopathological change (BUA 211 (1998)), Based on all information, the compound was classified into Category 3 (respiratory tract irritation)."
