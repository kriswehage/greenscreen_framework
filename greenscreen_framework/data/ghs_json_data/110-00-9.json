In RTECS (1995)of Priority 2, there is a description of abnormalities in the structure or function of trachea or bronchus in the study where the value in the rat treated with 4-hr inhalation for 60 days of LOAEL: 0.2mg/L (equivalent to the guidance value of Category 2) was obtained, and of abnormalities in central nervous system in the study where the value in the rat treated with 4-hr inhalation for 26 weeks of LOAEL: 0.005mg/L (equivalent to the guidance value of Category 1\" was obtained. Referring to the primary literature of RTECS (Toksikologiya Novykh Promyshlennykh Khimicheskikh Veshchestv, 9, 106 (1967), ibid., 10, 35 (1968)), the former tracheal or bronchial abnormalities are accompanied by local lung emphysema under the exposure condition where the rat treated with 2-hr/day inhalation for 30 days of 1.0-1.3mg/L (equivalent to the guidance value of Category 1), but the latter symptoms of central nervous system are considered to have been seen in the study to obtain the lethal dose (LC50) and there was no description of functional disorder of central nerve in the subacute and chronic toxicity studies. Therefore, it is defined as Category 1 (liver, kidney, respiratory system) and Category 2 (testis, ovaria). Moreover, since the result of atrophy of testis and ovaria in the rat given a dose of 60mg/kg/day was obtained in the subacute toxicity study and there is no description of effects on ability of reproduction and offspring, it was determined as a rationale for classification of this hazardous property.
