In other oral tests with rats, extensive periportal necrosis was observed at a dose of 30 mg/kg, and hepatocyte necrosis with increased ALP activity and lipid peroxidation was noted at a dose of 85.4 mg/kg (SIDS (2005)), which indicated that the liver is a target organ.

There were no adverse effects on the other sexual function or reproductive parameters, and external examination of offspring revealed no abnormalities (SIDS (2005)).

The total litter loss was observed at middle and high dose levels at which serious general toxicity including maternal deaths was observed (SIDS (2005)).
