The similar symptoms were reported following dermal or inhalation exposure to rats or mice except that inhalation caused respiratory irritation. The oral LD50 values in these species ranged from 320 mg/kg to 620 mg/kg, the dermal LD50 value is 370 mg/kg, and the inhalation LC50 values ranged from 0.78 mg/L/4h to 1.34 mg/L/4h. Since significant toxic effects are produced at dose levels within the guidance value range for Category 2 by oral and dermal routes, and Category 1 by the inhalation route, the substance was classified into Category 1 (central nervous system).
