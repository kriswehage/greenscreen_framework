The methemoglobin-production was observed following oral administration to cats at dose levels of 25 - 50 mg/kg (ACGIH (2001)). In an oral test with rats, agitation, adynamia, convulsions, paresis and respiratory disturbance were noted at dose levels of 510 - 800 mg/kg (BUA Report No. 97 (1992)). Based on the data, target organs were considered to be the blood system, the nervous system and the respiratory system. Since the effects on the blood system were observed at dose levels within the guidance value range for Category 1, the substance was classified into Category 1 (blood system). Since the effects on the nervous system and respiratory system were observed at dose levels within the guidance value range for Category 2, the substance was classified into Category 2 (nervous system, respiratory system). In a case report of two people who ingested the substance, rhabdomyolysis, increased liver deviation enzyme, acute renal failure, popliteal discoloration, degeneration of renal tubule, stromal edema in the kidney, hepatic cell necrosis and bronchopneumonia are reported (IUCLID (2000)). This data was not used as the basis of classification since these effects may were induced by exposure to a mixture of the substance with other substances.",
