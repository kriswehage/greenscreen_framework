This red pulp atrophy is caused by a reduction in extramedullary hematopoiesis, but since no changes are observed in bone marrow hematopoietic cells or peripheral blood on a hemogram, it is believed that red pulp atrophy is not a change which indicates effects on hematopoietic functions. Therefore, based on this oral administration study in rats, it was judged that the lien should not be included in the specific target organs for repeated exposure. Moreover, according to Hagan et al's (1993) inhalation exposure test using rats, no effects on the lien were observed. Since the values in the other organs are within the guidance value ranges of \"Category 2\"in both species tests and no significant toxic effects have not been seen, it is proper to be classified as \"Not classified\" if based on GHS classification. Therefore, \"Category 2 (lien)\" of three-ministry GHS classification result is corrected to \"Not classified\".",

Moreover, there are three study examples which meet the OECD Guidelines in 1981 and after, with the results of \"slightly irritating\" (simple obstruction, 1981), \"highly irritating\" (obstruction, 1981), and \"not irritating\" (simple obstruction/obstruction, 1985).
