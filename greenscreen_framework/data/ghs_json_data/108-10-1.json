F1 males showed transient or consistently depressed body weight at all dose groups. The only effect reported in offspring was significantly depressed body weights on day 14 post-partum in F1 and F2 male and female pups. No other changes were observed in any reproductive or developmental endpoint. In a developmental toxicity test by inhalation exposure to rats and mice during organogenesis period (EHC 117 (1990)), maternal toxicity with decreased body weight gain and clinical signs, and fetotoxicity with reduced fetal body weight per litter and delays in skeletal ossification were observed in rats. In mice, exposure to high concentration produced maternal toxicity with increased mortality, paresis, irregular gait, and fetotoxicity (increased incidence of dead fetuses, reduced fetal body weight per litter). There was no treatment-related increase in embryotoxicity or fetal malformations, i.e. teratogenicity. The increased incidence of dead fetuses (0.6% vs. control value 0.1%) cannot be disregarded. However, since the adverse effect was only observed in the high dose group in which maternal death (3/25) occurred, this data was not used as the basis of classification. Since there were no adverse effects on parental sexual function and fertility in the two-generation inhalation test in rat and no adverse effects on fetal development in the rat and mouse developmental toxicity tests, the substance was classified as \"Not classified\".",
