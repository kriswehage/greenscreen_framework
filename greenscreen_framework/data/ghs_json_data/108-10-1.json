But it was estimated that there is no stimulant even under a test condition severer than the OECD Guidelines in general (6 time as many valid time as this, blockade application) by the joint controlled trial using a rabbit by 23 research-institute (PATTY (4th 1994)). So it was set as the outside of Category."
