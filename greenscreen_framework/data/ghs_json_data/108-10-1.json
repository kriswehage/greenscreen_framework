The only effect reported in offspring was significantly depressed body weights on day 14 post-partum in F1 and F2 male and female pups. No other changes were observed in any reproductive or developmental endpoint. In a developmental toxicity test by inhalation exposure to rats and mice during organogenesis period (EHC 117 (1990)), maternal toxicity with decreased body weight gain and clinical signs, and fetotoxicity with reduced fetal body weight per litter and delays in skeletal ossification were observed in rats. In mice, exposure to high concentration produced maternal toxicity with increased mortality, paresis, irregular gait, and fetotoxicity (increased incidence of dead fetuses, reduced fetal body weight per litter). There was no treatment-related increase in embryotoxicity or fetal malformations, i.e. teratogenicity. The increased incidence of dead fetuses (0.6% vs. control value 0.1%) cannot be disregarded. However, since the adverse effect was only observed in the high dose group in which maternal death (3/25) occurred, this data was not used as the basis of classification.

            "rationale": "In an inhalation test in guinea pigs, irritation of the eyes and nose was observed in relatively low concentrations (EHC 117 (1990)). Irritation of the nose and throat was reported in humans after inhalation exposure (EHC 117 (1990), PATTY (5th, 2001), IRIS (2003)) and in some cases individuals complained about respiratory irritation (EHC 117 (1990). Based on these results, the substance was classified into Category 3 (respiratory tract irritation). Narcosis was observed in inhalation tests in guinea pigs and mice (EHC 117 (1990), PATTY (5th, 2001)), and rats exhibited CNS depression, loss of coordination and collapse in another test (PATTY (5th, 2001)). In addition, central nervous system depressant, dizziness and narcosis were reported in humans following inhalation exposure (EHC 117 (1990), IRIS (2003), ECETOC JACC (1987)). Based on the data, the substance was classified into Category 3 (narcotic effects). Severe central nervous system depressant and histopathological findings including fatty livers and congestion of the brain are also reported in guinea pigs and rats (EHC 117 (1990)), however, the findings were observed at high dose levels exceeding the guidance value range.",
