The second test showing positive effect (EHC 139 (1992)) is difficult to evaluate due to lack of a dose relationship. Finally, the negative result of the third test is employed as a conclusion (ECETOC JACC (1990)). Additionally, a negative result was observed in an inhalation rat bone marrow chromosome aberration test (in vivo somatic cell mutagenicity tests) (EHC 139 (1992)). Based on all data, the substance was classified as \"Not classified\". As relevant information, from in vitro mutagenicity tests, there are reports of negative results for an Ames test and a BHK 21 cell transformation assay.\n"
