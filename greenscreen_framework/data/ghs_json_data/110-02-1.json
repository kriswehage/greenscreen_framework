                "In a combined repeat dose and reproductive/developmental toxicity screening test with rats (OECD TG422) (for approximately 45 days), no death was observed in either sex but clinical signs such as irregular respiration, decreased locomotor activity, prone position and salivation were observed at 100 mg/kg in males and 400 mg/kg in females. On histopathological examination for males, hypertrophy of hepatocytes and infiltration of macrophages in the central zones were observed at 100 mg/kg and higher dosage levels. At 400 mg/kg, necrosis of hepatocytes and homogenous or vesicular cytoplasmic change of hepatocytes in the central zones were observed as well as increases in the concentrations of plasma total bilirubin and activities of various enzymes. Thus, hepatic toxicity was noted in the groups administered 100 mg/kg or higher doses. In addition, at 400 mg/kg slight toxicity to the cerebellum was indicated, since pyknosis/necrosis of granular cells in the cerebellum was observed for one male. In surviving females, hepatic changes similar to those observed in males of the 400 mg/kg group were found in the groups administered 100 mg/kg or higher doses. In addition, necrosis of cerebellar granular cells was observed in the groups given 100 mg/kg or more. In the 400 mg/kg group, dilatation and edema of the ventricles were evident. Thus, it was suggested that the substance at the dose level of 100 mg/kg or more is toxic to the liver and the cerebellum (\"Toxicity Testing Reports of Environmental Chemicals\" (Chemicals Investigation Promoting Council) (access on Aug. 2009). Based on above information, the substance was classified into Category 2 (liver, brain)."

However, poor maternal behavior and lactation were observed in the 100 mg/kg and more groups and the lower tendency of viability on postnatal day 4 in the 400 mg/kg group was attributed to the poor maternal behavior and lactation (\"Toxicity Testing Reports of Environmental Chemicals\" (Chemicals Investigation Promoting Council) (access on Aug. 2009)). Since these dams showed degeneration of cerebellar nuclei neurons, poor maternal behavior and lactation were considered to be a secondary consequence by thiophene-treated (\"Toxicity Testing Reports of Environmental Chemicals\" (Chemicals Investigation Promoting Council) (access on Aug. 2009)). In conclusion, classification was not possible since data for developmental toxicity including teratogenicity were insufficient."
