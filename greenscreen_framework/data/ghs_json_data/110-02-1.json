On histopathological examination for males, hypertrophy of hepatocytes and infiltration of macrophages in the central zones were observed at 100 mg/kg and higher dosage levels. At 400 mg/kg, necrosis of hepatocytes and homogenous or vesicular cytoplasmic change of hepatocytes in the central zones were observed as well as increases in the concentrations of plasma total bilirubin and activities of various enzymes. Thus, hepatic toxicity was noted in the groups administered 100 mg/kg or higher doses. In addition, at 400 mg/kg slight toxicity to the cerebellum was indicated, since pyknosis/necrosis of granular cells in the cerebellum was observed for one male. In surviving females, hepatic changes similar to those observed in males of the 400 mg/kg group were found in the groups administered 100 mg/kg or higher doses. In addition, necrosis of cerebellar granular cells was observed in the groups given 100 mg/kg or more. In the 400 mg/kg group, dilatation and edema of the ventricles were evident.
