Based on these reports, the substance was classified into Category 1 (nervous system, pancreas, liver, heart). In addition, of 285 AIDS patients with CD4 counts of <=300 cells/microL, who received the substance for 17 months, 14% had anaemia or neutropenia, (IARC 76 (2000). Anemia was reported in 3.1-8.4% of patients who received the substance alone or in conjunction with zidovudine and leukopenia, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia occurred (HSDB (2004)). Based on the data, the substance was classified into Category 1 (blood system). In addition, there are the following reports as significant adverse reactions; lactic acidosis, esophageal and intraoral ulcer, anaphylactic reaction, and subarachnoid hemorrhage (JAPIC prescription drug book (2010)). Since these symptoms cannot identify the affected organ, the substance was classified into Category 1 (systemic toxicity).

The deaths were due to thymic lymphomas in the females, whereas the male mice died from toxic effects such as anaemia (IARC 76 (2000)).
