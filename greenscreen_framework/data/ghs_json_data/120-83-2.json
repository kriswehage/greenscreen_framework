In addition, it was implied that the substance did not directly affect fecundity (NTP TR353 (1989)). Similar results were obtained after mice of both sexes were administered for 90 days with the substance mixed in water, mated, and continued to be administered through the gestational period: there were no effects on fertility, and fetal toxicity was not observed (IUCLID (2000)). From these 2 documents, it was concluded that the substance has no adverse effects on reproductive functions and fertility. Furthermore, developmental toxicity tests were conducted in which rats were orally administered during the organogenetic period. Decreased body weight of maternal animals occurred at all doses tested, and delayed ossification and mortality of early embryos were observed (IARC 71 (1999)). However, these adverse effects were associated only with high doses that caused mortality of parental animals, and thus do not provide grounds for classification. No adverse effects on the offspring were detected. Overall, since no adverse effects were recognized on reproductive functions, fertility, and development of the offspring, the substance was classified into \"Not classified\".",
