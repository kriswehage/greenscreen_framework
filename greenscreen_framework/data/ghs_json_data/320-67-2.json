In offspring that were born from mothers administered from day 14 of pregnancy, nervous or hepatic tissues had been destroyed. 5-azacytidine particularly affected cell division and proliferation in the liver and brain at doses that were not toxic to maternal animals. IARC 50 (1981) reported that single intraperitoneal doses of 1-2 mg/kg to mice during the period of embryogenesis can cause a high resorption rate and malformations in the majority of surviving fetuses, including major central nervous system defects, facial clefts and limb defects. In conclusion, since signs of reproductive toxicity appeared at doses that did not induce general toxicity to parental animals, the substance was classified into Category 1B."
