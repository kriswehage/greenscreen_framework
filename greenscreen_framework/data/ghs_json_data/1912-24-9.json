But in the test using rat which was performed in after years, generating of the tumor relevant to dose even at the dose of a maximum of 400ppm was not seen (Agricultural Chemical Registration Data, 1995). Moreover, in carcinogenicity tests using mice, generating of the tumor relevant to administration up to 3000ppm was not observed (Agricultural Chemical Registration Data, 1989).
