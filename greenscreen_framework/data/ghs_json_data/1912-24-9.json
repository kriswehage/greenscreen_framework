In addition, in pesticide registration trial in Japan, incidence of mammary gland tumors increased for females which received 70 - 1000ppm in the carcinogenicity tests using rat (Agricultural Chemical Registration Data, 1987). But in the test using rat which was performed in after years, generating of the tumor relevant to dose even at the dose of a maximum of 400ppm was not seen (Agricultural Chemical Registration Data, 1995). Moreover, in carcinogenicity tests using mice, generating of the tumor relevant to administration up to 3000ppm was not observed (Agricultural Chemical Registration Data, 1989). And as a result of estimation by the pesticide residues safety assessment committees, it is concluded that there is no fear of carcinogenicity to humans.   "
