Similarly, in rat two-generation oral administration, no effects of administration related to reproduction or birth were detected (SIDS (J), accessed in October 2008). Also, in oral administration tests conducted during the organogenetic period using rats or rabbits, the substance was found to be not developmentally toxic or teratogenic (IUCLID (2000)). As a result of exposure to the test substance in the tests mentioned above, there were no adverse effects on sexual functions and fertility of parental animals, and development of offspring. Thus, the substance was classified into the \"Not classified\" category.",
                "While maternal toxicity can be found at the level even less than 10mg/kg in the 2 generation reproductive toxicity study via oral administration using rats conforming to GLP, no effect was caused in F1 and F2 generations even at the level of 200mg/kg. On the other hand, in the developmental toxicity study conforming to GLP 3 cases of miscarriage have been confirmed at the dose amount (40mg/kg) where 8 out of 18 parent animals died (IUCLID (2000)). It is not appropriate to ignore reproductive toxicity, judging the fetal toxicity (miscarriage) as the secondary effect, even when the dose amount 40mg/kg is a low dose level where parent animals die.
