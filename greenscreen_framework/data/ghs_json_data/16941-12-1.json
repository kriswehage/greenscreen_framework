In Japan Society For Occupational Health (JSOH), the following statement is found: \"occupational exposure to water-soluble platinum salts causes allergic reaction, and asthmatic symptoms and skin sensitization are observed\". Water-soluble platinum salts were classified as sensitizer (Category 1 for the respiratory tract and skin) (Recommendations for allowable concentrations (2008 and 2000)). The substance is water-soluble (Merck (14th, 2006)). Based on these information, the substance was classified into Category 1. As relevant information, the substance is classified into R42/43 in EU classification (EU-Annex I (access on July 2009)) and Asthma mark is assigned in ACGIH (ACGIH-TLV (2009))."
