In a 4-hour inhalation test with rats, increased methaemoglobin was noted at a dose level of 2.8 mg/L (mist because of the substance's saturated vapour pressure concentration of 0.055 mg/L) (EU-RAR 65 (2006)). In addition, there are reports that acute intoxication in humans and animals is indicated by the symptoms of cyanosis, fatigue, dyspnoea, and muscle weakness (PATTY (5th, 2001)) and that like other chloroanilines, the primary toxic effect of the substance is methaemoglobin formation and acute intoxication is indicated by the symptoms of methaemoglobinemia (cyanosis), fatigue, dyspnoea, and muscle weakness (EU-RAR (2006)). Based on the data, the substance was classified into Category 1 (blood system). Additionally, based on a report that clinical signs at doses of 500 - 800 mg/kg included paralysis of the hind extremities (EU-RAR 65 (2006)), the substance was classified into Category 2 (nervous system).",
                "In oral administration tests using rats, paralysis of hind legs was observed at 500-800mg/kg. In 24-hour dermal administration tests using rats, cyanosis was observed in all dose groups, and in 4-hour mist inhalation tests (saturated vapor pressure = 0.055mg/L), high values of methemoglobin were detected at 2.8mg/L (EU-RAR (65, 2006)). From these results, the substance was classified into Category 2 (nervous system, blood system).",
                "Patty (5th, 2001) has a description of \"cyanosis, a feeling of worthlessness, breathing difficulty, and loss of muscle strength\" as acute conditions to animals and humans, and EU-RAR (2006) has a description that \"an initial toxic effect is methemoglobin formation like other Chloroaniline. The cyanosis, a feeling of fatigue, dyspnea, and a muscular power fall were indicated as acute symptoms by methemoglobinemia.\" Moreover, as for animals, the inhalation exposure test which employed rats showed that \"a deep sleep, the abnormalities in a walk, an ataxic gait, and a rise of methemoglobin level\" (EU-RAR (2006)) were seen within the limits of Category 2 from Category 1. As mentioned above, it was classified into Category 1 (blood systems). "
