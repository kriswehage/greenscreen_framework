In a second test where rats were orally administered from day 12 to day 16 of gestation at a dose level of 67 mg/kg/day, slightly decreased maternal bodyweight gain, increased resorption ratio and slightly decreased number of pups born alive were reported (Initial Environmental Risk Assessment of Chemicals (Ministry of the Environment) (vol. 7, 2009)).
