Oral administration to pregnant monkeys resulted in vaginal ridging and/or cervical hooding in offspring (IARC vol. 21 (1979)). In mouse oral tests, increased pituitary weight and unclear estrus cycle in female offspring and atrophy of the epididymides and prostate in male offspring were observed (NTP DB Report#RACB830`46 (access on Oct. 2009)).
