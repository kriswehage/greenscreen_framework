Based on this report, the substance was classified into Category 2 (kidney). Additionally, in 3-month mixed diet administration tests, hepatic centrilobular hypertrophy and necrosis were detected at >= 1000 ppm (132 mg/kg/day for male and 232 mg/kg/day for female) in mice and at >= 3000 ppm (158 mg/kg/day for male and 195 mg/kg/day for female) in rats; in both studies, doses administered were above Category 2 guidance values (JMPR (1992)).
