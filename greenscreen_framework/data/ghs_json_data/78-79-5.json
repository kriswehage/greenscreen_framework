In a 26-week inhalation test with mice (dose levels: 0.195 - 19.5 mg/L), increased incidences of hindlimb paralysis, spinal cord degeneration, degeneration of the olfactory epithelium, epithelial hyperplasia of the forestomach, and macrocytic anemia were observed. Grip strength of the hindlimb in the 220 ppm (0.613 mg/L) and higher concentration exposure groups was significantly lower than that in the control group (SIDS (2005)). After 26 week of recovery, the incidence of degeneration of the spinal cord was significantly increased in all treatment groups (SIDS (2005)). Since degeneration of the spinal cord is considered to be a cause of hindlimb paralysis and this effect occurred at dose levels within the guidance value range for Category 1, the substance was classified into Category 1 (nervous system). The significant increase in the incidence of degeneration of the olfactory epithelium was observed in the 220 ppm (0.613 mg/L) and higher treatment groups after 26 weeks of recovery. In isoprene rubber production workers, atrophic processes in the upper respiratory tract, catarrhal inflammation, and degeneration of the olfactory tract were noted (IARC vol. 71 (1991)). Based on these data, the substance was classified into Category 1 (upper respiratory tract). Since hepatocyte degeneration and hyperplasia of the forestomach were observed at dose levels exceeding the guidance value range for Category 2, the data were not used as the basis of classification. In a 2-week inhalation test in mice, a decrease in erythrocyte count and hemoglobin concentration was noted at dose levels of 438 ppm (90-day equivalence: 0.2 mg/L) (Hazard Assessment Report (CERI, NITE) (2006)). However, this data was not used as the basis of classification because of lack of other data for the effect on blood system.",
