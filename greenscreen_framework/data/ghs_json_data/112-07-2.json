In 2-year inhalation tests with ethylene glycol mono-n-butyl ether in rats and mice, an increase in the incidence of combined benign plus malignant pheochromocytomas of the adrenal medulla in female rats was equivocal, however the incidences of liver hemangiosarcoma in male mice and squamous cell papilloma or squamous cell carcinoma in female mice were increased (SIDS (access on June 2008)).",

In an acute oral toxicity test with rabbits (LD50 value of 2400 - 3300 mg/kg: corresponds to \"Not classified\"), hemoglobinuria, hematuria, nephrosis, tubular dilation, tubular necrosis and hyaline droplet degeneration were noted (SIDS (access on June 2008)).

In a case of an 18-year old male ingesting 360 - 480 mL of window cleaning product containing 22% ethylene glycol monobutyl ether (2-butoxyethanol (the metabolite)), CNS depression and metabolic acidosis were observed (SIDS (access on June 2008)). In a second case, a 50-year old woman ingested a window cleaning product (i.e. 30 - 60 mL butoxyethanol) with the main effects being coma, absence of response to pain stimulus, breathing difficulties, metabolic acidosis, hypokalemia, and haemoglobinuria inducing progressive erythropenia (SIDS (access on June 2008)). In a third case, a 23-year old woman ingested a window cleaning product (i.e. 63 mL butoxyethanol) with the main effects being coma, dilated pupils, obstructive respiration, metabolic acidosis, hyperventilation, depression of blood haemoglobin concentration and haematuria. (SIDS (access on June 2008)). As reported, CNS depression, metabolic acidosis, erythropenia and decreased hemoglobin are noted in humans following ingestion of the substance.
