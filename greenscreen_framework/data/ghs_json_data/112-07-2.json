For ethylene glycol monobutyl ether acetate which is an in vivo hydrolysate of ethylene glycol monobutyl ether acetate, in 14-week inhalation tests in rats and mice, hemolytic anemia and histological lesions consistent with hemolytic anemia in liver, kidney, bone marrow and spleen were observed at dose levels of 62.5 - 125 ppm (within the guidance value range for Category 2) in both species (SIDS (access on June 2008)).",

Thus, the substance was classified into Category 2 (hematopoietic system). As relevant notes, ethylene glycol monobutyl ether, a byproduct resulted from hydrolysis of ethylene glycol monobutyl ether acetate in the body, was also studied. Applying this byproduct at 62.5-125 ppm (Category 2 equivalent) or above to rats and mice in 14-week inhalation exposure tests, hemolytic anemia was shown in both animals, and signs of anemia were observed in the liver, kidney, bone marrow, and spleen (SIDS (accessed in June 2008))."

In an acute oral toxicity test with rabbits (LD50 value of 2400 - 3300 mg/kg: corresponds to \"Not classified\"), hemoglobinuria, hematuria, nephrosis, tubular dilation, tubular necrosis and hyaline droplet degeneration were noted (SIDS (access on June 2008)). Additionally, slight hemoglobinuria and hematuria were noted at a dose level of 400 ppm (2.6 mg/L: corresponds to Category 2) (SIDS (access on June 2008)). Based on the data, the blood system and kidney were regarded as target organs. In a case of an 18-year old male ingesting 360 - 480 mL of window cleaning product containing 22% ethylene glycol monobutyl ether (2-butoxyethanol (the metabolite)), CNS depression and metabolic acidosis were observed (SIDS (access on June 2008)). In a second case, a 50-year old woman ingested a window cleaning product (i.e. 30 - 60 mL butoxyethanol) with the main effects being coma, absence of response to pain stimulus, breathing difficulties, metabolic acidosis, hypokalemia, and haemoglobinuria inducing progressive erythropenia (SIDS (access on June 2008)). In a third case, a 23-year old woman ingested a window cleaning product (i.e. 63 mL butoxyethanol) with the main effects being coma, dilated pupils, obstructive respiration, metabolic acidosis, hyperventilation, depression of blood haemoglobin concentration and haematuria. (SIDS (access on June 2008)). As reported, CNS depression, metabolic acidosis, erythropenia and decreased hemoglobin are noted in humans following ingestion of the substance. Based on the human data, the substance was classified into Category 1 (central nervous system, blood system, systemic toxicity). In addition, based on the rat data reported above, the substance was classified into Category 2 (kidney).",

In oral acute toxicity tests (LD50 = 2400-3300mg/kg: equivalent to \"Not classified\"), hemoglobinuria, bloody urine, nephrosis, expansion of renal tubules, necrosis of renal tubules, and degeneration of hyaline droplets were observed. In addition, hemoglobinuria and bloody urine have been also observed by inhalation exposure at 400ppm (2.6mg/L: equivalent to Category 2), although they were less severe. Based on toxic symptoms observed with oral and dermal administrations, erythrocytes and kidneys were considered as target organs; and the LD50 values for these organs indicated that these symptoms occurred at the doses in the range of Category 2 guidance values or higher. Thus, the substance was classified into Category 2 (erythrocyte, kidney)."

In 2-year inhalation exposure tests using rats and mice that were applied with ethylene glycol monobutyl ether, frequencies of developing both benign and malignant pheochlromocytoma in adrenal medulla increased in female rats, making the results ambiguous. However, in mice, occurrences of angiosarcoma in livers increased in males, and occurrences of squamous papilloma or squamous cell carcinoma increased in females, providing evidence of carcinogenicity (SIDS (accessed June 2008)). Based on these results and the fact that this substance has been classified into A3 by ACGIH (2003), the substance was classified into Category 2."
