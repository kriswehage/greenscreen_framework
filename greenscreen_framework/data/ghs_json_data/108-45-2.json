In animals, reported effects are as follows; \"an abundance of degenerative lesions with a significant increase in the numbers of pyknotic hepatocytes in the livers\" at 18 mg/kg following a 13-week oral exposure in rats (ACGIH (2001)); \"methemoglobinemia\" at 100 mg/kg (90-day equivalence: 31.1 mg/kg) following a 4-week oral exposure in rats; \"chronic renal disease\" at 40 mg/kg following a 104-week oral exposure in rats (Initial Environmental Risk Assessment of Chemicals (Ministry of the Environment) vol. 3 (2004)); and \"impairment of liver and central nervous system\" at 5.6 mg/kg and higher dose levels following a 4-month oral exposure in rats (IUCLID (2000)).

In the second test, one human subject was applied 1%, 5% and 10% solutions of the substance in alcohol, lanolin or Vaseline, and no visible effect was observed within 24-hour (DFGOT vol. 6 (1994)).
