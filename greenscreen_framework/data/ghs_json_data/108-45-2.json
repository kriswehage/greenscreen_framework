            "rationale": "In humans, there is a report of \"abnormal reflex, cutaneous hyperesthesia and pathological changes in the kidney and liver\" (Initial Environmental Risk Assessment of Chemicals (Ministry of the Environment) vol. 3 (2004)). In workers, following long-term exposure to the substance \"dysuria, edema of mucosa, polypous swellings and (eosinophilic) infiltration of the area of the triangle and cervix of the urinary bladder\" were reported as effects (ACGIH (2001)). In animals, reported effects are as follows; \"an abundance of degenerative lesions with a significant increase in the numbers of pyknotic hepatocytes in the livers\" at 18 mg/kg following a 13-week oral exposure in rats (ACGIH (2001)); \"methemoglobinemia\" at 100 mg/kg (90-day equivalence: 31.1 mg/kg) following a 4-week oral exposure in rats; \"chronic renal disease\" at 40 mg/kg following a 104-week oral exposure in rats (Initial Environmental Risk Assessment of Chemicals (Ministry of the Environment) vol. 3 (2004)); and \"impairment of liver and central nervous system\" at 5.6 mg/kg and higher dose levels following a 4-month oral exposure in rats (IUCLID (2000)). The nervous system, liver, kidney, urinary bladder and blood system are considered to be target organs. Since the findings in animals were noted at dose levels within the guidance value range for Category 1 and 2, the substance was classified into Category 1 (nervous system, liver, kidney, urinary bladder) and Category 2 (blood system). Additionally, there are reports of \"pulmonary fibrosis, skin thickening of fingers\" and \"reflux esophagitis, pedal oedema, bradycardia, heart block, sclerodactyly, teleangiectasis over the fingers, pulmonary fibrosis, and dilation of oesophagus\" (IUCLID (2000)), however, these effects were derived from exposure data for amine mixtures which contained the substance as the main component (Initial Risk Assessment Report (NITE, CERI, NEDO) No. 54 (2008)).The substance was not classified into Category 2 (cardiovascular system, respiratory system) since these effects may were induced by exposure to a mixture of the substance with other substances.",

Reported effects on the blood system include cyanosis observed at 100 - 200 mg/kg following oral exposure in mice (IUCLID (2000)). Oral exposure in cats at a dose level of 10 mg/kg and higher concentrations resulted in an increased methemoglobin concentration in blood (Initial Risk Assessment Report (NITE, CERI, NEDO) No. 54 (2008)). Based on the data, the substance was classified into Category 1 (central nervous system, blood system). There is a report of \"acute pulmonary edema following dermal exposure\" (RTECS (2004)), however, this information regarding the respiratory system is on a document in List 3, therefore, the data was not used for this classification.",
