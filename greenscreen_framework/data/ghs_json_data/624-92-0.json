At the dosage in the guidance value range of Category 2 (0.2-1.0 mg/L), the reduction of erythrocyte count, the hemoglobin concentration decrease, and the decrease of a hematocrit value (PCV value) were seen in the rat (IUCLID (2000)). Although at a higer dose, the similar changes were observed also with the rabbit, and it was accompanied by increased reticulocyte counts and increased hematopoietic (PATTY(5th, 2001) vol.7). It is presumed that cause of the effect on erythropoiesis and heme synthesis is inhibition to uptake of Fe to reticuloendothelial system in humans (IUCLID (2000)).
