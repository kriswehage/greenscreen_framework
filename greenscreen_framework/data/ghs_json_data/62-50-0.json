In addition, there are report that intraperitoneal injection to rats caused defect of limb and head (Birth Defects (3rd, 2000)) and that the substance produced subfertility and larger doses caused complete sterility in mice (IARC vol. 7 (1974)). It was also reported that intraperitoneal injection to pregnant mice induced high frequencies of midgestation and late fetal deaths, and of malformations among some of the surviving fetuses (HSDB (2008)).
