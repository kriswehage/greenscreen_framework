However, this value is higher than its water solubility of 43 mg/L (HSDB, 2007). Since no reliable test results are available, classification is not possible. As additional background information, another toxicity test on fish, which is reported together with the above crustacean test, was an inadequate test (considered as a preliminary test with a limited sample size). In addition, since exposure concentrations reported are higher than the water solubility of this substance, this test is also not very reliable. "

However, according to NTP TR 365 (1989), this study does not provided sufficient evidence that this substance is carcinogenic. Similarly, in another 2-year mixed diet administration test using mice (maximum dose: 50000 ppm), the substance was evaluated to be not carcinogenic.\nWhile no classification of the substance has been carried out by authorized agencies, no clear carcinogenic effects were detected in carcinogenicity studies using two species of rodents. Thus, the substance has been classified into the \"Not classified\" category by specialists."
