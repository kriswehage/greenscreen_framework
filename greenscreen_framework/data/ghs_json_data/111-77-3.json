Observed malformations include external malformations like anasarca, anury, and subcutaneous hematomas, as well as visceral malformations in the cardiovascular system such as double aortic arch, right aortic arch, and ventricular septal defect (EU-RAR vol. 1 (1999). With regard to visceral malformations, they increased in a dose-dependent manner, and their increase was clearly seen even at low administration doses (600 mg/kg/day or 700 mg/kg/day) that did not induce general toxicity in maternal animals (EU-RAR vol. 1 (1999), HSDB (2007)). Based on these results, the substance was classified into Category 1B. Regarding the effects of the substance on the development of offspring, malformations were found in a majority of organs in mice (Teratogenic 12th (2007)). In addition, an increase in resorbed embryos were detected in rabbits, though the adverse effect was weak (PATTY (5th, 2001)).
