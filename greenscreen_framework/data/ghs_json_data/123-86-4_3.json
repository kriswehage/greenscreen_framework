The NOEL was reported to be 500 ppm (2.38 mg/L/6h) (DFGOT vol. 19 (2000)). However, classification as \"Not classified\" is questionable due to no data from specific investigations to evaluate the neurotoxic potential of the substance.

In mice, after inhalation exposure of 8000 ppm for 20 minutes (11 mg/L/4h), abnormal posture, decrease in arousal level, tonic/clonic movement, and delay of righting reflex were observed (PATTY (5th, 2001)). Although the neurologic symptoms observed in the worker resolved fast and was not serious, the symptoms in animals were observed at dose levels within the guidance value range of Category 2. Based on the animal results, the substance was classified into Category 2 (central nervous system).
