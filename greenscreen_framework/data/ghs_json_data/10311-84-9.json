These are not necessarily dosage dependence. And it is considered that in one case of JMPR, the toxicity of chemicals is not the main causes for increased mortality of embryonic and fetus. Since any data did not have the descriptions on general toxicity of parent animals and reproductive toxicity had been manifestation. So it was considered as Category 2."
