The positive rates were 1) 40% (4/10) in experimental group, 0% (0/5) in control group, 2) 0% (0/10) in experimental group, 20% (1/5) in control group, and 3) 0% (0/10) in experimental group, 0% (0/5) in control group. While the first test produced conflicting results (positive rate of 40%), the weight of evidence does not indicate that zinc oxide is a very potent sensitizing agent (EU-RAR (2004)). In a patch test for contact allergy, no positive responses were observed in the 14 patients when only zinc oxide was used (EU-RAR (2004)). It was concluded in EU-RAR (2004) that Zinc oxide does not have to be classified/labelled for skin sensitization, therefore, the substance was classified as \"Not classified\".",
