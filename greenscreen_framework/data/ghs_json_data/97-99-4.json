In these tests, extended estrous cycle and failed parturition were observed, and early embryo resorption was detected in females being administered 500mg/kg/day by uterus examination. At the administration dose of 150mg/kg/day or higher, a prolonged gestational period, and decreased pregnancy rate, delivery rate, birth rate, and survival rate 4 days after birth were observed (SIDS (2005)). Furthermore, oral administration tests at 500mg/kg/day or higher during the organogenetic period resulted in early resorption in 100% of treated female rats (SIDS (2005)). At these toxic doses, decreased body weight gain and decreased food consumption in parental animals were observed.
