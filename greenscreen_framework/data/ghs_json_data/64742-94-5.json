In addition, in 13-week inhalation exposure tests using rats, notable functional disorder of the organs was not detected other than an increase in organ weight (liver and kidney) and low-grade anemia at the doses (1.8, 3.7, and 7.4 mg/L) that are above the upper limit of guidance values (IARC 47, 1989). Based on these results, the substance was classified into \"Not classified\" for inhalation route. In 13-week oral administration tests using rats, effects of the administration on the liver, stomach, thyroid gland or bladder were detected (IUCLID, 2000). However, since the tests were conducted using doses (300, 600, and 1000 mg/kg bw /day) that were above the upper limit of guidance values, classification was not possible. As relevant notes, Patty 5th (2001) reported, with regard to the signs of chronic toxicity, that depending on the amount of benzene content, depression of the central nervous system and mild to severe changes in the hematopoietic system may occur.",

In dermal administration tests using rabbits, drowsiness and changes in motor activity were detected (RTECS, 2006; original literature: National Technical Information Service. OTS0534724). According to a description in Patty 5th (2001), regarding acute toxicity through oral, dermal or inhalation route, the substance is associated with eye, nasal or throat irritation, vertigo and nausea, dyspnea, CNS depression, and coma. Based on these results, the substance was classified into Category 3 (respiratory tract irritation and narcotic effects).",
