Additionally, there is a report the classification is based on the data of animal tests rather than epidemiological researches for occupational exposure therefore, the relevance to humans is unknown. In contrast, alcoholic beverages are classified into Category 1 in IARC based on numerous epidemiological tests on consumption of alcoholic beverages (IARC vol. 44 (1987)). In re-evaluation in 2007, alcoholic beverages and ethanol in alcoholic beverages are classified into \"Group 1\" (IARC vol. 96 summary (access on Oct. 2009)).

The most affected target organ is the liver; beginning with fatty degeneration, damage can progress via necrosis and fibrotic stages to liver cirrhosis (DFGOT (1996)). Based on this information, the substance was classified into Category 1 (liver). There is a report that patients with severe physical dependence caused by alcohol consumption experience craving and drug-seeking behavior and hyperreflexia with nausea, weakness, anxiety and sweating, in addition to the elicitation of a withdrawal syndrome of tremors, seizures and delirium (HSDB (2003)). Based on this information, the substance was classified into Category 2 (central nervous system). In animal tests, there were little adverse effects. In 90-day repeated oral tests in rats and mice, fatty degeneration of the liver was seen at high dose levels exceeding the guidance value range (SIDS (2009)).",

            "rationale": "In an inhalation exposure test in humans, stupor, drowsiness and slight paralysis were observed (ACGIH (2001)). The acute toxic effects of ingested ethanol on the central nervous system are generally known (DFGOT vol. 12 (1999)). Severe intoxication is characterized by marked muscular incoordination, blurred or double vision, stupor, hypothermia, vomiting and nausea, and convulsions; Following large ingestion of the substance, coma, depressed reflexes, respiratory depression, hypotension, and death from respiratory or circulatory failure or as the result of aspiration of stomach contents in the absence of a gag reflex occur (PATTY (5th, 2001)). In addition to the reported symptoms such as stupor and drowsiness in humans, there are reports of signs of narcosis, drowsiness and ataxia in inhalation exposure tests in rats, mice and guinea pigs (SIDS (2009), DFGOT vol. 12 (1999)). Based on these data, the substance was classified into Category 3 (narcotic effects). By inhalation exposure of the vapour to humans, the respiratory and eye irritant effects occur at low concentrations (ACGIH (2001)). In human subjects, following inhalation exposure, there is a report of coughing and smarting of the eyes and nose (PATTY (5th, 2001)). In an inhalation exposure test in nontolerant subjects, nasal irritation was reported (PATTY (5th, 2001)). Based on the data, the substance was classified into Category 3 (respiratory tract irritation).",
