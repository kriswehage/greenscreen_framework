Inhalation of copper fume results in irritation of the upper respiratory tract and an influenza-like illness termed metal fume fever. Signs and symptoms of metal fume fever include fever, chills, dry throat cough, and lassitude. There is usually leucocytosis; recovery is usually rapid, and there are no sequelae (HSDB (2003)).
