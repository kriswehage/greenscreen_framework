            "rationale": "As general poisoning symptoms in humans, peripheral nerve disorders, CNS depression, and skin and respiratory irritation are documented (Patty 5th, 2001). As symptoms of overexposure or inhalation exposure, CNS depression and irritation of respiratory tracts are reported (HSDB, 2005). As acute neurotoxic effects, anesthesia, euphoria, vertigo, and limb numbness are recorded (HSDB, 2005). In addition, there is a description that the accidental use of the substance as an anesthetic drug may cause reversible cerebral edema (Patty 5th, 2001). In animal studies, though animal species used were unknown, narcotic effects and irritation to respiratory tracts were detected in inhalation tests (EHC 20, 1982). Based on these results, the substance was classified into Category 3 (respiratory tract irritation and narcotic effects).",
