Atropy of the nasal olfactory epithelium was observed in male and female rats and mice exposed to 0.6 mg/m3 and higher concentrations. Chronic inflammation of the lung, lymphoid hyperplasia of the bronchial and mediastinal lymph nodes were observed in male and female mice exposed to 1.2 mg/m3 and higher concentrations (NTP TR453 (1996), Hazard Assessment Report (CERI, NITE) (2007), ECETOC TR-33 (1989)).
