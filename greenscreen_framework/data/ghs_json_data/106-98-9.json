NOAEL is reported to be higher than 8000 ppm, which is the highest concentration tested (SIDS (J) (2008)). The tests, though they are screening tests focusing only on rats, are reliable and valid tests, and found that NOAEL is greatly higher than the cutoff value (250 ppm) of Category 2 guidance values (at least 10 times higher), indicating that the substance falls under the \"Not classified\" category (inhalation). However, since no data on other administration routes are available, the substance was classified into the \"Classification not possible\" category."
