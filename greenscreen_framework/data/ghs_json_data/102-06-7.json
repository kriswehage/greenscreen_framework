It has been summarized in recent literature (Contact Derm.54 (2006)) that although 4 of 5 users of the surgical gloves comprising the substance were positive in the human patch test, a conclusion cannot be drawn because of few subjects. Therefore, classification is not possible.",

In addition, according to the Japanese Society for Contact Dermatitis HP (2008), although positive reaction examples have been indicated in the human patch test, examples confirmed as a cause chemical has not been reported yet. In SIDS-DRAFT (2002), human data of IUCLID (2000) and HSDB (2005), etc. is indicated, and also the negative result of maximization test using guinea pig by OECD Guideline (reliability: valid without restriction), and it is concluded that it is inferred that human positive reaction is not a direct reaction of the substance but a cross-reactivity. In the recent literature (Contact Dermatitis, 54, 61-62, 2006), it is summarized that a conclusion cannot be drawn due to lack of subjects though four of the five subjects using surgical gloves, including this substance, were positive in the human patch test. From the above, it was considered that it could not be classified."
