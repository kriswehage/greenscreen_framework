Furthermore, at 25 ppm (90-day conversion: 0.037mg/L), severe respiratory distress were observed. Thereafter, the animals exhibited drastic loss of body weight and died of respiratory failure.(SIDS (accessed in July 2008)).

These symptoms continued for 7 days after the application, suggesting possible permanent visual impairment (SIDS (accessed July 2008)). From these results that indicate its irreversible effects on the eyes, the substance was classified into Category 1."

In addition, lethargy was observed at all doses tested in acute toxicity tests using rabbits that underwent dermal administration (SIDS (accessed in July 2008)). Based on these results, the substance was classified into Category 3 (narcotic effects). In terms of respiratory irritation, exposing rats via inhalation for 8 hours under saturated vapour pressure did not cause mortality, but was associated with dyspnea and severe irritation of the mucous membranes (SIDS (accessed in July 2008)). Also, inhalation exposure at 3 ppm caused irritation of the nasal cavities, and cases of respiratory tract irritation among plant workers have been documented (SIDS (accessed in July 2008)). Based on these documents, the substance was classified into Category 3 (respiratory tract irritation)."
