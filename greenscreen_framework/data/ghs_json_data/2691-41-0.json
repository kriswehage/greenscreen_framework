NOAEL were 50 mg/kg/day for males and 115 mg/kg/day for females (IRIS (1988)). The LOAEL for liver damage in males is slightly above the upper limit of Category 2 guidance values and NOAEL is within the range of Category 2 guidance values, indicating that liver damage may occur at doses that fall under Category 2. Thus, the substance was classified into Category 2 for its toxicity to the liver. Regarding female rats, the LOAEL and NOAEL for kidney damage are reported to be 270 mg/kg/day and 115 mg/kg/day, respectively. Since the NOAEL is above the upper limit of Category 2 guidance values, we determined that the substance falls under the \"Not classified\" category for its toxicity to the kidney."

Compared to an unexposed control group, the prevalence of antinuclear antibodies, which is a biological indicator of lupus erythematosus, was not significantly different in exposed workers (ATSDR (1997)). However, since munitions workers were also exposed to other substances including TNT and RDX in addition to this substance, no clear conclusion was drawn (ATSDR (1997)). In another study, a guinea pig skin sensitization test gave negative results, but no details such as test methods are provided.
