And there is the case which leads to hospital admission (SIDS (1997)). Moreover, the effect to central nervous systems, blood, kidney, liver is mentioned (ICSC (2003)). Considering all the various information together, it is classified into Category 1 (central nervous system, blood, kidney, liver). On the other hand, there is the statement about \"a irritation of nose and throat\"(SIDS (1997)) in human inhalation test, and the statement about \"the irecurrent rritation to respiratory, and a dry cough\" in another case paper (HSDB (2004)).
