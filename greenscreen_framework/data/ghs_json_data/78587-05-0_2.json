Given these results, no changes by administration are detected on sex ratio, external abnormalities, skeletal abnormalities, or visceral abnormalities in embryos and fetuses (Pesticide Safety Information (Japan Crop Protection Association) (AGCHEM AGE No.154, 1999)). In addition, no signs of teratogenicity were detected in embryos and fetuses by administration of 2160 mg/kg/day to rats or administration of 1080 mg/kg/day to rabbits (JMPR (1991), Pesticide Safety Information (Japan Crop Protection Association) (AGCHEM AGE No.154, 1999)).

Also, no effects of administration on offspring were detected in terms of survival rate of newborn offspring, or development and differentiation (Pesticide Safety Information (Japan Crop Protection Association) (AGCHEM AGE No.154, 1999)).
