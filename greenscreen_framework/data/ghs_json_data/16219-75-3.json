In an oral preliminary reproductive toxicity test in rats, centrilobular hepatocyte hypertrophy and cellular vacuolization were noted at a dose level of 100 mg/kg/day (90-day equivalence: 50 mg/kg/day) and higher dose levels (\"Toxicity Testing Reports of Environmental Chemicals\" (Chemicals Investigation Promoting Council) (2005)).

Treatment-related effects were also observed in the kidney and thyroid (SIDS (2002)). However, these effects were not used as the basis of classification since the kidney effects are consistent with male-rat-specific alpha-2u-globulin nephropathy which is not relevant for humans and the thyroid effects are reversible following a 4-week recovery period and the toxicological significance of these effects are unclear.",

Also in dog repeated dose inhalation toxicity studies , fibrillization of liver, the increase in deviation enzyme, and hyperplasia briliary tract are mentioned with the dosage of guidance value within the limits of Category 2(SIDS (2004)).

In an inhalation acute toxicity test, rats showed hindlimb paralysis, absent surface righting and toe and tail pinch reflexes at dose levels of 10.8 - 16.9 mg/L (SIDS (2002)). Inhalation exposure to dogs caused tonic convulsions at dose levels of 10.7 - 15.9 mg/L (HSDB (2005)). At these concentrations within the guidance value range for Category 2, signs are predominantly those of a central excitatory nature, particularly tremors, and convulsions (SIDS (2002)). For humans, exposure to the substance can cause nausea, vomiting, headache, confusion and respiratory distress (PATTY (5th, 2001)). Based on the data, the substance was classified into Category 1 (central nervous system). Human volunteers noted irritation of eyes and nose following 30-min exposures. The vapour is irritating to the throat and will cause coughing or difficult breathing (PATTY (5th, 2001)). Based on the data, the substance was classified into Category 3 (respiratory tract irritation). There is a report that diarrhea, gastrointestinal hemorrhage and distension of the stomach were noted in a rabbit dermal test (HSDB (2005)). However, this data was not used as the basis of classification since the gastrointestinal hemorrhage is considered to appear at a very high dose only and similar results are not observed in other tests.",

There is the description that there is the diarrhea, gastrointestinal bleeding, and gastrointestinal distension in the dose of the guidance value range (2000 > = C > 1000mg/kg) of Category 2 in the dermal administration to rabbit.
