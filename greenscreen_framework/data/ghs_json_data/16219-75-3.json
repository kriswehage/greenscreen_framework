In an inhalation acute toxicity test, rats showed hindlimb paralysis, absent surface righting and toe and tail pinch reflexes at dose levels of 10.8 - 16.9 mg/L (SIDS (2002)).

Based on the data, the substance was classified into Category 1 (central nervous system). Human volunteers noted irritation of eyes and nose following 30-min exposures. The vapour is irritating to the throat and will cause coughing or difficult breathing (PATTY (5th, 2001)).
