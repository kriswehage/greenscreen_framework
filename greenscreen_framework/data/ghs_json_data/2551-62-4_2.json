In occupationally exposed workers, signs such as cyanosis, semicomatose, pulmonary oedema and slight acidosis were reported (EHC 227 (2002), PATTY (5th, 2001)), but these signs can be caused by asphyxiation and toxicity of breakdown products (EHC 227 (2002)) or may be caused by impurities (HSDB (2009)). Therefore, the substance was considered to correspond to \"Not classified\" with inhalation. However, based on reports that the substance has a narcotic effect (PATTY (5th, 2001)) and in very high concentrations has a weak anesthetic effect but is otherwise a virtually inert gas (HSDB (2009)), the substance was classified into Category 3 (narcotic effects).",
