            "rationale": "Following oral administration of the substance to rats and mice, hypnotic signs appeared (SIDS (access on Apr. 2009)). As a symptom following inhalation exposure to guinea pigs and oral administration to rabbits, anesthesia is reported (SIDS (access on Apr. 2009)). Based on the data, the substance was classified into Category 3 (narcotic effects). Since there are reports that a high concentration exposure resulted in deaths and that symptoms noted at acute toxic doses (LD50: 1300 - 3500 mg/kg) were CNS depression, the substance was classified into Category 2 (central nervous system). Based on the findings of hemorrhage of lungs in rat by oral administration of 475 - 3800 mg/kg (SIDS (access on Apr. 2009)) and lesions such as congestion and edema of the lungs, focal to diffuse hemorrhage of the lung parenchyma (SIDS (access on Apr. 2009)), the substance was classified into Category 1 (respiratory system). Pronounced irritation of the nose and throat observed in a volunteer test (ACGIH (2003)) is judged to be an effect on the respiratory system rather than respiratory tract irritation. In accidental or suicidal exposure cases (DFGOT vol. 10 (1998), PATTY (5th, 2001)), findings of hepatic dysfunction such as hepatitis, elevation of hepatic enzymes, swelling of hepatocytes and inflammatory infiltration were observed. However, these case reports were not used as the basis of classification since these effects were induced by exposure to mixtures and other components may be responsible. Although there is a report for the effects on spleen (PATTY (5th, 2001)), the data were not used as the basis of classification since the animal species, dose levels and exposure periods were not specified and no related information is found in other documents.",
