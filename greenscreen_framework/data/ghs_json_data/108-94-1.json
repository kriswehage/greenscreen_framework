Since there are reports that a high concentration exposure resulted in deaths and that symptoms noted at acute toxic doses (LD50: 1300 - 3500 mg/kg) were CNS depression, the substance was classified into Category 2 (central nervous system).

Pronounced irritation of the nose and throat observed in a volunteer test (ACGIH (2003)) is judged to be an effect on the respiratory system rather than respiratory tract irritation.
