After administration to rats for 90 days at 32 or 64 mg/kg/day, in addition to increase in GPT, alkaline phosphatase activity, and serum bilirubin concentrations, dose-related changes from infiltration by inflammation to degeneration have been reported (JMPR 892 (1995)). In a test in which dogs were exposed for two years, at doses of 500 ppm (approximately 25 mg/kg/day) or more, elevated serum GPT, swollen, vacuolated hepatic cells, and marginal proliferation of the portal triads with cellular infiltration were observed, and as findings of final examination, hepatic cirrhosis and hepatitis were described (JMPR 892 (1995)). Also, it was documented that as results of exposure of mice for two years, in males at 1500 - 7500 ppm (approximately 75 - 375 mg/kg/day), hepatotoxicity from centrilobular hypertrophy and necrosis was seen (JMPR 892 (1995)). Since adverse effects on the liver range extend to the dose equivalent to guidance values of Category 2 in multiple animal species as described above, the substance was classified into Category 2 (liver). As relevant information, such as tubular dilation and hydropic degeneration, bronchitis, and lymphocyte depletion at the thymus glands are described as other findings (EHC 149 (1993), JMPR (1995)). However, since these results lack consistency in multiple tests using multiple animal species or with solitary occurrence, and their reliability as evidence is doubted, they were not used as evidence.",

Furthermore, according to the WHO document (WHO Pesticides residues in food (1995)), the enlargement of liver was observed in rats of both sexes 6 weeks after the commencement of 13-week study with a dose of 1,350 ppm (equivalent to 135 mg/kg/day) mixed with foods. However, this lesion was not accompanied by histopathological changes and was reversible (NOAEL450 ppm, 35 mg/kg/day).

While, in a study in which rats were administered 50, 100, 200, or 400 mg/kg/day bw of carbendazim by gavage, administration of 200, 400 mg/kg/day markedly altered sperm morphology, testicular and epididymal weights, sperm counts, and testicular histology in males, and in females, postimplantation losses at high doses and a few malformed rat pups at 100, 200 mg/kg/day bw were found (EHC 149 (1993)). After administration of 400 mg/kg/day bw to male rats for 10 days, atrophy of the seminiferous tubule were found and rats with unrecovered fertilizing ability were seen (PATTY 5th (2001)). In a test in which 0, 5, 10, 20, or 90 mg/kg/day bw of carbendazim was administered to female rats on 7 - 16 days of gestation, administration of 90 mg/kg/day bw showed a decreased pregnancy rate and increase in the incidence of early resorptions, administration of 20 and 90 mg/kg/day bw showed reductions in fetal weight, administration of 90 mg/kg/day bw indicated an increase in the incidence of fetal malformations (such as hydrocephaly, microophthalmia, anophthalmia, and malformed scapulae) (EHC 149 (1993)). In addition, in rabbits, administration of 20, 125 mg/kg/day bw on 7 - 19 days of gestation showed a slightly decreased implantation rate, administration of 125 mg/kg/day bw indicated an increased incidence of resorption (EHC 149 (1993)).

Therefore, it was classified in Category 1B. Incidentally, EU Annex 1 is Cat.2; R60-61, corresponding to GHS Category 1B. "

While, in a test of NMRKf mice, no dose-dependent incidence of hepatocelluar adenoma was observed (EHC 149 (1993)).

The same study examples of EHC 149 (1993) are quoted in WHO Documents (WHO Pesticides residues in food (1995), WHO/FAO Data sheets on pesticides No.89 (1996)), where the presence of the carcinogenicityity is not clearly described. Moreover, EPA/OPP describes their views as follows; \"Data is insufficient for defining the carcinogenicity mechanism of action in mouse liver tumors caused by this substance and for analyzing the existing study examples. Therefore, a relation between heteroploidy induced by this substance and the carcinogenicityity of the mouse liver cancer cannot be determined at present\" (Mutation Res., 512, 1-35, 2002).
