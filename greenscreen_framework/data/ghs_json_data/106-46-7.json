In mice, increased incidences of hepatocellular carcinoma and histiocytic sarcoma in the liver were observed in the males, and increased incidences of hepatocellular carcinoma, hepatocellular adenoma and bronchiolo-alveolar carcinoma in the lung were observed in the females. The results indicated the carcinogenicity of p-dichlorobenzene in male and female Crj:BDF1 mice.
