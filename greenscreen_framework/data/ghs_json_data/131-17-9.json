In oral administration tests using rats and dermal administration tests using dogs, oedematous haemorrhage in the lung, intestine and liver and pulmonary congestion were the most common symptoms observed. However, no information on administration doses was provided. In addition, periportal liver cell necrosis in dogs (administration doses unspecified), and increased levels of the enzymes aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and alkaline phosphatase were found (DFGOT (vol.9, 2007)). High levels of ALT were also observed in rats (Fischer 344) that received doses of 400mg/kg bw, and in mice (B6C3F1) that received instillation (i.v.) of 900mg/kg bw (DFGOT (vol.9, 2007)). Thus, based on high levels of enzymes detected in treated dogs and rats (Fischer 344), and since this substance is documented to be hepatotoxic (PATTY (5th, 2001)), the substance was classified into Category 2 (liver)."

No abnormality was observed in terms of numbers of corpora lutea, implantation site, rates of losing pre- and post-implantation embryos, and survival rates of the offspring. Although atrophy of epididymis was observed in male rats, there was no significant difference in epididymides weights relative to bodyweight. (SIDS, accessed in July 2008). Overall, since other information on reproductive toxicity in males was lacking, the substance was classified into \"Classification not possible\"."

However, the tests were not conducted with the maximum tolerance dose, and did not provided sufficient data (NTP TR 242, 1983). In 103-week oral administration (0-100mg/kg) tests using rats, mononuclear cell leukemia and bile duct hyperplasia were observed in females administered at 100mg/kg. However, highly variable data made the results ambiguous (NTP TR 284, 1985).
