The effects seen in test animals were associated with doses that fall under the range of Category 1 guidance values.\nRegarding the effect of hydrazine (CAS: 302-01-2) on humans, the following were observed: jaundice, pneumonia, elevated creatinine levels, urine proteins, and bloody urine, focal hepatocellular necrosis, severe nephritis, necrosis of renal tubules, glomerulonephritis (Hazard Assessment Report (CERI, NITE), No. 73, 2003), pleural effusion and lung shadowing shown in X-ray examinations, elevated bilirubin levels in the blood, and pneumonia and hepatocellular damage revealed by autopsy (EHC 68, 1987).
