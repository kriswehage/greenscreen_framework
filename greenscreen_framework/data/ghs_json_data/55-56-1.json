The first case involved a 54-year-old nursing auxiliary who experienced frequent attacks of cough and wheezing within minutes after using an aerosol containing this substance, and in a challenge test with this substance, her forced expiratory volume in 1 second fell, accompanied by chest tightness and cough. The second case involved a 43-year-old midwife with a 6 month history of chest tightness after exposure to this substance and alcohol aerosol. A bronchial provocation test showed a fall in forced expiratory volume in 1 second. Neither woman had a history of asthma and no increased airways responsiveness to histamine was demonstrated in either case. The use of this product was stopped, and both nurses remain free of symptoms. It is concluded that the diagnosis of occupational asthma was confirmed (HSDB (2004)). Additionally, there are reports that following intermittent or repetitive use of chlorhexidine, asthma and anaphylactic shock occur as instant responses (FROCH, TEXTBOOK OF CONTACT DERMATITIS). The substance was classified into Category 1."
