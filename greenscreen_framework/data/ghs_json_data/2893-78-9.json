Necropsy findings such as liver dysfunction, irritation of the digestive tract, and lung congestion were noted (HSDB (2003)). Based on a report that the oral toxicity is apparently due to corrosive action on the stomach (HSDB (2003)), these findings are considered to be systemic toxicity caused by the strong irritation to the digestive tract.
