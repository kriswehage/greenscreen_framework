        "Based on the evidence from animal studies (though there are some data suggesting the classification into \"Not Classified\"): The LD50 value of the substance depends a lot on the speed of administration because the substance administered intravenously disperses into body fluids quickly; quick administration results in the formation of calcium chelate, which reduces calcium ion concentrations in the serum quickly, thereby causing tetany (uncontrolled contractions of extremity muscles, laryngeal muscles, respiratory muscles, etc.) and death eventually; LD50 values, therefore, do not allow for easy comparison (NITE Initial Risk Assessment No.14 (2005)).
