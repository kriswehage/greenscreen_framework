However, the report concluded that \"The subjects were not healthy individuals so it is possible that the symptoms which presented may be caused by underlying conditions,\" so it was not used. On the other hand, HSDB (2005), which is the source of information for List 2, contains reports on humans that \"a man who received oral administration for 3-4 months presented hepatic encephalopathy, kidney failure and severe coagulopathy,\" and \"a man who received it for 7 weeks suffered severe cerebropathia.\" For animals, there are reports that \"brown discoloration was observed as non-tumorous lesions in the adrenal gland\" in a 25-week oral carcinogenicityity study in mice and that \"hepatic lesions, reticuloendothelial cell hyperplasia, liver cirrhosis and bile duct hyperplasia were observed\" in 15- and 25-week oral gavage administration study in hamsters (EHC 68 (1987)). Since the effects for both mice and hamsters are within the range of guidance values for Category 1, it was classified as Category 1 (liver, adrenal gland) and Category 2 (kidney, blood system, central nervous system).

                "In humans who ingested hydrazine sulfate three times a day for 1 to 6 months, vomiting, dizziness, excitation, insomnia, and polyneuritis syndrome were observed (ATSDR, 1997). In tests in which hamsters underwent forced oral administration for 15 to 20 weeks, cirrhosis, reticuloendothelial cell hyperplasia, and bile-duct proliferation were observed (Hazard Assessment Report (CERI, NITE), 2004). These reports indicated that the nervous system and liver are target organs. The effects seen in test animals were associated with doses that fall under the range of Category 1 guidance values.\nRegarding the effect of hydrazine (CAS: 302-01-2) on humans, the following were observed: jaundice, pneumonia, elevated creatinine levels, urine proteins, and bloody urine, focal hepatocellular necrosis, severe nephritis, necrosis of renal tubules, glomerulonephritis (Hazard Assessment Report (CERI, NITE), No. 73, 2003), pleural effusion and lung shadowing shown in X-ray examinations, elevated bilirubin levels in the blood, and pneumonia and hepatocellular damage revealed by autopsy (EHC 68, 1987). In treated animals, the following changes were observed: proliferation of the liver and bile-duct, degeneration of the adrenal gland, inflammation of the nasal mucosa, and necrosis, scaling, hyperplasia, and squamous cell metaplasia of the nasal epithelium (Hazard Assessment Report (CERI, NITE), No. 73, 2003). Based on these reports, we think hydrazine's target organs are the liver, respiratory system, kidney, and adrenal gland. All the effects seen in test animals were associated with doses that fall under the range of Category 1 guidance values. Based on the information above, this substance was classified into Category 1 (nervous system, liver, respiratory system, kidney, and adrenal gland).\n"
