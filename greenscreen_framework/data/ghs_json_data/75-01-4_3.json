Exposure of workers to a 2.5% concentration of the substance for 3 minutes caused dizziness and disorientation (EHC215 (1999)). In workers who were occupationally exposed to vinyl chloride (compensation cases in Japan), poisoning symptoms, including dizziness, photophobia, vomiting and disorientation were observed following acute exposure, and severe arrhythmia, collapse, unconsciousness and sometimes death were observed following acute, high dose exposure (July 29, 1976, Kihatu No. 556). Based on the data, the substance was classified into Category 1 (central nervous system). There is a report that the main symptoms after a single exposure are narcotic effects (DFGOT vol. 5 (1993)). In inhalation tests with rats, mice, guinea pigs and dogs, deep narcosis is reported (EHC215 (1999)). Based on the data, the substance was classified into Category 3 (narcotic effects).",
