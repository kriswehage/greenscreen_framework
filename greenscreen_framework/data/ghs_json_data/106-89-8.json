Since these findings were noted at dose levels within the guidance value range for Category 1, the substance was classified into Category 1 (kidney). Inflammation, focal erosion, hyperplasia and squamous metaplasia in the turbinate airway epithelium were observed at 25 ppm (0.095 mg/L) and higher concentrations following a 13-week inhalation exposure period in rats and mice (Hazard Assessment Report (CERI, NITE) No. 74 (2008)). Lung disorders, mainly edema, congestion and pneumonia were observed at a dose of 100 ppm (0.378 mg/L, 90-day equivalence: 0126 mg/L) following a 30-day inhalation exposure period in rats (ACGIH (7th, 2001)). Purulent rhinitis, sinusitis and pneumonia were observed at 25 ppm (0.095 mg/L) and higher concentrations following a 10-week inhalation exposure period in rabbits (Hazard Assessment Report (CERI, NITE) No. 74 (2008)). Since these findings were noted at dose levels within the guidance value range for Category 1, the substance was classified into Category 1 (respiratory system). Effects on the heart and central nervous system are reported (Hazard Data Book for Chemical Substance (CERI) 96-48 (1998)) based on a literature published in 1966 (Fomin, A.P.: Gig. Sanit. 31 (9); 7-11). However, toxic effects are not reported in subsequent tests including repeated exposure tests, therefore, the heart and central nervous system are not considered to be target organs.",

            "rationale": "In inhalation tests, necrosis and ulceration in the respiratory tract and olfactory epithelium were observed following 6-hour exposure (vapour) of 697 ppm (4-hour equivalent: 3.957 mg/L) in mice (Hazard Assessment Report (CERI, NITE) No. 74 (2008)). Pulmonary edema and hemorrhage were observed following 6-hour exposure (vapour) of 283 - 445 ppm (4-hour equivalent: 1.608 - 1.684 mg/L) in rats (IRIS (2008)). Based on the data, the substance was classified into Category 1 (respiratory system). In oral tests in rats, polyuria, increased kidney weight and changes in urine component were observed at 7 - 350 mg/kg, and renal failure was noted in approximately 80% of animals at 125 mg/kg (Hazard Assessment Report (CERI, NITE) No. 74 (2008)). Nephropathy accompanied by vacuolization is reported at 325 - 500 mg/kg following oral exposure in rats and mice (Hazard Assessment Report (CERI, NITE) No. 74 (2008)). Since adverse effects were noted at dose levels within the guidance value range for Category 1 with the inhalation and oral routes, the substance was classified into Category 1 (kidney). In the oral tests in rats and mice (325 - 500 mg/kg) reported above, fatty degeneration in the liver was also observed (Hazard Assessment Report (CERI, NITE) No. 74 (2008)). There is a case report of an accidental massive systemic exposure, where an enlarged liver with jaundice is reported, and fatty degeneration together with functional disturbances of the liver persisted for more than two years (ACGIIH (2001)). Based on the data, the substance was classified into Category 1 (liver).",
