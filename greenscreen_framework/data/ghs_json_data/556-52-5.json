In a 103-week oral test in rats, the incidences of gliomas of the brain and forestomach tumours were increased in both sexes. The incidence of mesotheliomas of the tunica vaginalis/peritoneum, and tumours in the intestine, Skin thyroid, and Zymbal gland were increased in male rats, and the incidences of tumours of the clitoral gland, mammary gland, oral mucosa and leukaemia were increased in female rats. In a 103-week oral test in mice, the incidence of Harderian gland tumours was increased in both sexes, and increased incidences of tumours of the forestomach, lung, liver and skin in males, the mammary gland and subcutis in females were observed (IARC vol. 77 (2000)). In a 104-week inhalation test in rats, the incidences of nasal cavity tumor and peritoneal tumor were significantly increased in males, and the incidences of nasal cavity tumor and uterine tumor were increased in female. The results are considered to be clear evidence of carcinogenic activity of 2,3-Epoxy-1-propanol for male and female F344/DuCrlj (Fischer) rats. In a mouse test, the incidences of nasal cavity tumor, subcutaneous tissue tumor and peripheral nervous system tumor were increased in males, and the incidences of nasal cavity tumor, uterine tumor and mammary gland tumor were increased in females.

            "rationale": "In acute oral toxicity tests in rats and mice (LD50 values: 850 mg/kg for rats, 450 mg/kg for mice), symptoms of intoxication were initial depression of the CNS followed by hypersensitivity to sound with muscular tremors and facial muscular fibrillation. Some rats showed terminal convulsions (PATTY (5th, 2001)). In an acute dermal toxicity test in rabbits (LD50 value: 1980 mg/kg) and acute inhalation tests in rats and mice (vapour, LC50 values (4-hour equivalence): 1.36 - 1.78 mg/L), effects on the central nervous system were reported (DFGOT vol. 20 (2003), PATTY (5th, 2001)). Additionally, by inhalation, lung irritation, pneumonia and emphysema were also detected (PATTY (5th, 2001), ACGIH (2001)). Since these adverse effects are estimated to occur near or below the LD50 value (LC50 value) and the inhalation LC50 value is within the guidance value range for Category 1, the substance was classified into Category 1 (central nervous system, respiratory system).",
