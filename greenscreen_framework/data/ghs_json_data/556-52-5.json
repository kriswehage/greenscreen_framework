Some rats showed terminal convulsions (PATTY (5th, 2001)). In an acute dermal toxicity test in rabbits (LD50 value: 1980 mg/kg) and acute inhalation tests in rats and mice (vapour, LC50 values (4-hour equivalence): 1.36 - 1.78 mg/L), effects on the central nervous system were reported (DFGOT vol. 20 (2003), PATTY (5th, 2001)).

Since these adverse effects are estimated to occur near or below the LD50 value (LC50 value) and the inhalation LC50 value is within the guidance value range for Category 1, the substance was classified into Category 1 (central nervous system, respiratory system).",
