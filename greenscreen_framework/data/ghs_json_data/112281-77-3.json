In 4-week mixed diet administration tests using rats, enlargement of centrilobular to midzonal hepatocytes in 160 ppm groups and above was noted; and vacuolization of centrilobular to midzonal hepatocytes in 2500 ppm groups was detected. In 13-week mixed diet administration tests using rats, an increased liver weight and enlargement of centrilobular hepatocytes were observed in both sexes treated at 360 ppm and in females treated at 60 ppm (which falls under Category 1 guidance values). In 13-week mixed diet administration tests using mice, severity and incidence of centrilobular hepatocyte enlargement increased in 25 ppm groups and above, and midzonal hepatocyte vacuolation were noted for the females in 625 ppm groups. Single cell necrosis in the liver was notable for the females in 125 ppm groups and for both sexes in 625 ppm groups. Single cell degeneration was noted in the livers of both sexes in 625 ppm and 125 ppm groups. In 21-day oral administration tests using rabbits, signs of irritation were observed only at the site of application. In 12-month mixed diet administration tests using dogs, the enlarged hepatocytes and cortical tubular hypertrophy were noted in 360 ppm groups (all results cited in HSDB (2009)). Based on these results, though they were obtained using List 2 datasets, the substance was classified into Category 1 (liver) as liver abnormalities appeared at the Category 1 guidance concentrations in rat and mouse studies."

In forced oral administration tests conducted during the organogenetic period using pregnant rats, suppressed body weight gain in maternal animals and decreased food consumption were detected; there were no effects on survival of fetuses; and hydroureter along with increased rates of 14th rib(s) formation were detected in fetuses in the highest dose groups. In mixed diet administration tests conducted during the oranogenetic period using rabbits there were no effects on body weight and food consumption in maternal animals, and the development of fetuses (HSDB (2000)).
