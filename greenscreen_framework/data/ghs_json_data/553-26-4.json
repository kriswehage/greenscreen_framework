The fatality reaction curve of this substance is a steep slope, and the least fatal doses of female and male rats are 130 mg/kg and 160 mg/kg, respectively. Dead animals have lung hemorrhage, lung dropsy, intra-alveolar bleeding, atelectatic lung, and the congestion was also regarded in lungs, the kidney, and the lien. Moreover, taking into consideration the fact that agricultural-chemicals paraquat which is the dimethyl compound of this substance characteristically damage lungs, it is presumed that this substance's target internal organs are also lungs. In addition, although such symptom was equivalent to Category 1 by judging from the guidance value, it was classified into Category 2 (pneumoconiosiss) according to this guidance because it was data of List2, and doesn't meet the acceptance criteria 1b 3).
