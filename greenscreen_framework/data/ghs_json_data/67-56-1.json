In some cases death is the final outcome (DFGOT vol. 16 (2001), EHC 196 (1997)). Further, CNS disorders, especially parkinsonism-like extrapyramidal symptoms were reported (DFGOT vol. 16 (2001)). Morphological changes, necrosis in the white substance of the brain were demonstrated (DFGOT vol. 16 (2001)). Based on the human information, the substance was classified into Category 1 (central nervous system). Additionally, the eye was regarded as a target organ since visual impairment is a characteristic effect. Additionally, systemic toxicity is regarded as a target organ based on the reports of headache, nausea, vomiting, tachypnea and coma as signs of metabolic acidosis. The effects of single exposures by inhalation include narcosis (EHC 196 (1997), PATTY (5th, 2001)). As an acute toxicity in humans, a narcotic effect results from central nervous system depression (PATTY (5th, 2001)). Based on the data, the substance was classified into Category 3 (narcotic effects).",
