In some cases death is the final outcome (DFGOT vol. 16 (2001), EHC 196 (1997)). Further, CNS disorders, especially parkinsonism-like extrapyramidal symptoms were reported (DFGOT vol. 16 (2001)).

Additionally, systemic toxicity is regarded as a target organ based on the reports of headache, nausea, vomiting, tachypnea and coma as signs of metabolic acidosis. The effects of single exposures by inhalation include narcosis (EHC 196 (1997), PATTY (5th, 2001)).
