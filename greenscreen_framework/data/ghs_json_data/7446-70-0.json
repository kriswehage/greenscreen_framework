In 180-day tests using rats that underwent administration in drinking water, reduced spontaneous locomotor activity, impaired acquisition, extinction and reacquisition of an active avoidance task were observed at the dose of 12 mg Al/day per rat (59 mg AlCl3/day per rat), which falls under the guidance values for Category 2 (CaPSAR (2000). Furthermore, in 3-month tests using rats that underwent administration in drinking water, impairment of post-rotatory nystagmus was observed at the dose of 43.1 mg/kg/day, which falls under the Category 2 guidance values (ATSDR (2008)). Based on these results, the substance was classified into Category 2 (nervous system). Also, in 21-day forced oral administration tests using rats, a significant decrease in red blood cells, hematocrit, and serum iron concentration; an increase in platelets; and a decrease in hemoglobin were found, suggesting that exposure to aluminum may cause normocytic anemia (IUCLID (2000)). However, the exposure dose was 494 mg/kg/day (90-day conversion value: 115 mg/kg/day), which fell under the guidance values for the \"Not classified\" category."

In addition, in mixed diet tests using rats that were fed with 272 mg Al/kg/day (1343 mg AlCl3/kg/day) between day 1 and 20 of the gestational period, significant impairment in the righting reflex and grasping reflex were observed in rat pups, while toxic effects on the parents were unclear (ATSDR (2008)). Moreover, in forced administration tests using rats that were applied with 900 or 1800 mg/kg on day 15 of the gestational period, significant effects were detected on timing of pinna detachment and eye opening, and learning acquisition in offspring, while toxic effects on the parents were unclear. Since exposure to the test substance during prenatal period is documented to affect development and behavior of the offspring (IUCLID (2000)), the substance was classified into Category 2."
