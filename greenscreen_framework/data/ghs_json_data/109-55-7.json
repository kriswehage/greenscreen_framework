Its NOAEL is documented as 50mg/kg/day (SIDS accessed in June 2008; HSDB (2003); BUA report No. 197 (1996)). In humans, symptoms of respiratory disorder (lack of breath, chest constriction, and irritation of nasal cavities and pharyngeal mucous membranes, etc.) have been documented as a result of occupational exposure (SIDS accessed in June 2008; BUA report No. 197 (1996)). Oral exposure at 250mg/kg/day in rats for 28 days is equivalent to exposure at approximately 78mg/kg/day for 90 days.
