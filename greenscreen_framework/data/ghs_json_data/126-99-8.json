Exposure to male rats and mice resulted in sterility or impotence (ACGIH (2001)). There are marked disparities among reported test results, therefore, the weight of evidence for teratogenicity and reproductive toxicity is very limited and insufficient (ACGIH (2001)). The substance was classified into Category 2 since there is no sufficient evidence to classify it in Category 1. On IARC monographs (1979), cases of children born with physical and mental defects are reported for women working in a chloroprene factory. Additionally, a threefold excess of miscarriage by the wives of workers occupationally exposed to chloroprene were reported (IARC 19 (1979)). These findings are not found in other IARC monographs (1999). This same data are reported in other documents (ACGIH (2001) and NTP TR467 (1998)), however, these documents reported that the methods used to gather data in these tests were questioned.

Additionally, there are other reports of liver toxicity: a significant increase in the incidence of hepatocellular necrosis in rats following inhalation exposure to 200 ppm (0.724 mg/L) for 13-week (NTP TR467 (1998)) and observation of liver damage or jaundice in dogs and guinea pigs exposed via inhalation (SIDS (2009)).\nFor the blood system, inhalation exposure of rats for 13-week at concentration of 200 ppm (0.724 mg/L) produced normocytic, normochromic anemia (NTP TR467 (1998)), and inhalation exposure of mice for 13-week at concentrations of 32 ppm (0.116 mg/L) and higher produced significant decreases in hematocrit values and erythrocyte counts and a change in platelet counts (IARC 19 (1979)). Since these effects were observed at dose levels within the guidance value range for Category 1, the substance was classified into Category 1 (blood system).\nFor the nervous systems, 44% of patients with chronic chloroprene poisoning had pathological changes in the (cardiovascular and) nervous systems and symptoms such as dizziness and insomnia were reported (IARC 19 (1979)). It was reported that decreased blood cholinesterase activity occurred due to occupational exposure (IARC 19 (1979)). In rats, symptoms such as low motor activity, restlessness and lethargy were observed following exposure. Based on the information, the substance was classified into Category 1 (nervous systems).\nFor the stomach, in a 13-week inhalation test in mice (NTP TR467 (1998)), increased incidences of squamous epithelial hyperplasia of the forestomach occurred at dose levels of 80 ppm (0.290 mg/L) and higher concentrations. Additionally, there is a report that chronic exposure may result in gastrointestinal disorders (IARC 19 (1979)). Based on the information, the substance was classified into Category 1 (stomach).\nFor the respiratory system, inhalation exposure to rats for 4-week (PATTY (5th, 2001)) induced tissue damage to the lung at dose levels of 160 ppm (0.579 mg/L, 90-day equivalence: 0.178 mg/L) and higher concentrations which are within the guidance value range for Category 1. In a 13-week inhalation test in rats (NTP TR467 (1998)), increased incidences of olfactory epithelial degeneration and respiratory metaplasia occurred at dose levels of 80 ppm (0.290 mg/L) and higher concentrations. Additionally, there is a report that chronic exposure may result in respiratory irritation. Based on the information, the substance was classified into Category 1 (respiratory system).\nFor the cardiovascular system, based on a human case report that 44% of patients with chronic chloroprene poisoning had pathological changes in the cardiovascular and dystrophy of the myocardium (NTP TR467 (1998)), the substance was classified into Category 1 (cardiovascular system).\nFindings for the immune system were not used as the basis of classification, since the information was found in IARC monographs (1979) but not in other IARC monographs (1999) or other documents. The findings for the tooth/periodontal tissue were not used as the basis for classification since this information is only found in IARC 19 (1979) and introduction of NTP TR467 (1998) and not in other documents.",

In another test, markedly more hepatotoxicity with increased hepatic enzyme activity was reported at 500 ppm (1.810 mg/L) and higher concentrations (IARC 71 (1999)). Oral administration to rats produced CNS depression (PATTY (5th, 2001)). In rats respiratory failure by inhalation exposure was reported (IARC 71 (1999)). In humans, there is a report that the symptoms of acute inhalation exposure include nervous system depression, and injury to the lungs, liver and kidney (IARC 71 (1999)), but there is no report of detailed symptoms of CNS depression or a report associated with narcotic effects. Since the above effects were observed in rats at dose levels within the guidance value range for Category 1 and the effects were also observed in human cases, the substance was classified into Category 1 (central nervous system, respiratory system, liver, kidney).",
