The NOEL was reported to be 500 ppm (2.38 mg/L/6h) (DFGOT vol. 19 (2000)). However, classification as \"Not classified\" is questionable due to no data from specific investigations to evaluate the neurotoxic potential of the substance. For humans, there are epidemiological tests showing that symptoms such as dizziness and vertigo, chest pain, headaches, and nausea or neurobehavioral effects are associated with occupational exposure (ACGIH (2001), PATTY (5th, 2001)). The human data for the substance are difficult to evaluate since the reports deal with solvent mixtures rather than with exposure to the substance alone (ACGIH (2001)).

Based on this result, the substance was classified into Category 2 (respiratory system). In addition, it was reported that a worker who had been exposed to a solvent mixture composed of the substance (48%), xylene (26%) and ethylene glycol acetate (26%), experienced drowsiness with slight motor impairment (ACGIH (2001)). There is a report that very high concentration exposure may cause unconsciousness (Japanese journal of industrial health vol. 36 (1994)). In rats, after inhalation exposure to the vapour, ataxia, and narcosis were observed at 6867 ppm/4h (32.6 mg/L/4h) and decreased motor activity and hypoactivity were observed at 3000 - 6000 ppm/6h (17.5 - 34.9 mg/L/4h) (ACGIH (2001)). In mice, after inhalation exposure of 8000 ppm for 20 minutes (11 mg/L/4h), abnormal posture, decrease in arousal level, tonic/clonic movement, and delay of righting reflex were observed (PATTY (5th, 2001)). Although the neurologic symptoms observed in the worker resolved fast and was not serious, the symptoms in animals were observed at dose levels within the guidance value range of Category 2. Based on the animal results, the substance was classified into Category 2 (central nervous system). In human subjects, exposures to concentrations of 300 ppm for 2 - 5 minutes cause irritation of the pharynx (Japanese journal of industrial health vol. 36 (1994)).",

In rabbits, the incidence of morphological variations of the gall bladder and other anomalies (retinal folds, unsymmetrically fused breastbone) was increased. However, as these findings are generally regarded as variations and not as malformations, no adverse effects on fetal development including teratogenicity were observed (DFGOT vol. 19 (2000)). In a rat test by inhalation exposure during the 3 weeks before mating until organogenesis period, there were no adverse effects on parental sexual function and fertility (DFGOT vol. 19 (2000)).
