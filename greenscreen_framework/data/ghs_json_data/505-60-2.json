Ocular injury with the liquid substance is far more damaging to the cornea than vapour-induced injury, increasing the risk of perforation of the cornea, which may lead to permanent loss of vision (HSDB (2008)). Based on these reports, the substance was classified into Category 1. When the liquid was applied to the eye of rabbits, the histological features were nuclear pyknosis, necrosis and loss of polarity of corneal epithelial basal cells at 6 and 9-hour, and corneal epithelial cells presented degenerative changes, with the epithelium eventually detaching from the underlying basement membrane at 24-hour (HSDB (2008)).",
