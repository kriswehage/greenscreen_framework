Based on the data, the substance was classified into Category 3 (narcotic effects). In a mouse inhalation test, the irritation effect on the upper respiratory passages was recorded as the reduction in respiratory rate, which is triggered by reflex stimulation of receptors in the trigeminal nerve endings in the nasal mucous membranes (DFGOT vol. 11 (1998)). In addition, irritation to the respiratory system and mucosa is reported in humans (Japan Society For Occupational Health (JSOH) Recommendations for allowable concentrations (1998), PATTY (5th, 2001)). The substance was classified into Category 3 (respiratory tract irritation).",
