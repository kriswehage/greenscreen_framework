Also, in many tests in which animals orally received the substance during the organogenetic period, an increase in the number of resorptions and of malformed fetuses was noted, and in rats, hydronephrosis, limb and cardiac malformations, and in mice, digit and paw malformations have been reported (ECETOC TR95 vol. 2 (2005)). Furthermore, after oral exposure in male rats, testicular atrophy, damage, and loss of spermatocytes were seen (ECETOC TR95 vol. 2 (2005)). On the other hand, in humans, multiple epidemiological studies reported abortion and fetal malformations (ECETOC TR95 vol. 2 (2005)). Since, as described above, animal tests have obviously showed effects on parental fertility and development of fetuses, and also in humans, suggested adverse effects on the development of children, the substance was classified into Category 1B.
