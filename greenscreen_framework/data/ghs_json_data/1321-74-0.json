In 3312ppm, ataxia, tachypnoea, eye irritation, and rhinitis were developed during exposure, and the symtoms of decreased weight and lethargic developed for more than 14 days. In 4835ppm exposure, three of five animals dead within 24 hours, and after exposure bloody urine and decreased weight were observed in the survived individual (ACGIH (2001)). Thereby, it was classified into Category 3 (anesthetic action). Moreover, the respiratory tract irritation is reported as acute symptoms by the human occupation exposures (ACGIH (2001)). So it was classified into Category 3 (respiratory irritant)."

However, there is no effect to parent animals and new born in the dose 1000mg/kg or less (Health, Labor and Welfare Ministry reports (2006)). Since this effect is checked as secondary toxicity of parent animals because the toxicity is not occured in the next generation in the dose that parent animals do not have toxicity, it is classified into the Category 2."
