Similarly, effects of the test substance were not noted in inhalation exposure tests in which rats were exposed to 200 to 10000 ppm (90-day correction: 44-2222 ppm) for 20 days (ACGIH (2006)) or mice were exposed to 200 to 5000 ppm for 78 weeks(IARC vol. 60 (1994)). In addition, in inhalation exposure tests using rats or mice that were exposed to 5000 to 10000 ppm for 103 weeks (NTP TR 272 (1985)), no effects of the test substance are mentioned except for changes in nasal cavities such as squamous metaplasia, epithelial hyperplasia, and inflammation seen as non-neoplastic lesions. Changes in nasal cavities were not reported in exposure tests conducted for 2 to 14 weeks. Overall, these eight repeated inhalation exposure studies resulted in no toxic effects related to the test substance have being identified even at exposure doses above the guidance values, indicating that the substance falls under the \"Not classified\" category (inhalation). However, since no study results exploring other administration routes are available, the substance was classified into \"Classification not possible\"."
