There are 7 reports of sarcoma (rhabdomyosarcoma) at the injection site in intramuscular administration tests in rats (EHC No. 108 (1991), ECETOC TR No. 33 (1989)). In addition, there is a report that the incidence of renal cancer was significantly elevated by intrarenal injection (IARC vol. 49 (1990)).",
                "Nickel compounds are rated as \"Group 1\" by the IARC (IARC 49 (1990)), \"Group 1\" by Japan Society for Occupational Health (Recommendations of Occupational Exposure Limits (2005)), \"K\" by the NTP (NTP RoC (11th, 2005)), and \"Category 1\" by the EU. In addition, insoluble nickel compounds are rated as \"A1\" by ACGIH (ACGIH 7th, 2001). Based on these ratings, the substance was classified into Category 1A. As additional background information, seven separate carcinogenicity tests using rats that underwent intramuscular injection detected the development of local sarcomas (rhabdomyosarcomas) (EHC No. 108 (1991), ECETOC TR No. 33 (1989)). In addition, one test in which rats received intrarenal injection of this substance found a significant and marked increase in renal cancers (IARC vol. 49 (1990)).",
                "Due to the fact that the substance is classified as Category K by NTP (2005), Category A1 by ACGIH (2001) and Group 1 by IARC (1990)."
