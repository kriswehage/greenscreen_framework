When the substance was given to rat orally in the drinking water after day 7 of pregnancy, no teratogenic toxicity was found but inhibition of fetal growth was observed. From the effect dose level, it was conclude that the effects on fetal growth were considered to be a consequence of maternal acidosis (SIDS (2009)). There is a report that rats orally administered in the diet (6%) from day 9 to 12 of gestation showed metabolic acidosis, 60 fetuses were held and 20 fetuses were resorbed (IUCLID (2000)). This information was not used as the basis of classification because of a lack of detailed data and the absence of a control group. There is a report that mice administered 600 mg/kg orally 4 times on day 10 of gestation produced 7% ectrodactyly in the fetuses (Teratogenic (12th, 2007)), however, the data was not used as the basis of classification since the detailed data are not available and the daily dose (total 2400 mg/kg/day) is very high (the LD50 value is approx. 1500 mg/kg).
