In addition, with regard to the experiment that used Vanadium (V)oxide and whose effect on fetuses was identified it is considered inappropriate to make judgements based on the result of this experiment, because absence of the datum per each litter makes data analysis inappropriate and causes problems to the reliability in making decisions, as mentioned in CICAD.

Moreover, although they pointed out in the public comments that from the weight of evidence it is appropriate to adopt CICAD, according to GHS United Nations documents, even when data is not cited in documents highly regarded by experts, it is possible to use it for GHS classifications. As for the respiratory system, in ACGIH the TLV-TWA is set while taking respiratory effects into consideration, and in CICAD Respiratory tract irritation is given as a toxicological endpoint. Moreover, according to the data of Roshchin (1952) in ACGIH, nasal discharges including bleeding and focal lung edema are observed within the guidance value ranges of \"Category 1\" in the inhalation exposure test using rats. Therefore, it is considered proper to be classified as \"Category 1 (respiratory system)\". Referring to Sjoberg (1955), the primary literature of human data, which is also a rationale for three-ministry GHS classification, about effects on blood system and nervous system, it is concluded that \"no general toxicity which should be noted is observed\" though decreasing tendency in hemoglobin and significant fatigue symptoms are found in several patients. Therefore, it is not appropriate to regard blood system and nervous system as specific target organs for repeated exposure based on this literature. Referring to Handbook of the Toxicology of Metals. 2nd ed. (1986)for effects on the liver, fatty degeneration accompanied by focal hepatocellular necrosis is observed within the guidance value ranges of \" Category 2\" in the inhalation exposure test using rats. Therefore, \"Category 2 (liver)\" is considered poper in GHS classification. In addition, although the public comments have indicated that Vanadium are widely present in the nature and it is also taken from foods, it is not necessary to take the exposure into account in GHS classification, if based on UN documents on GHS. Based on the above, \"Category 1 (respiratory organs, blood system, nervous system, liver)\" was corrected to \"Category 1 (respiratory system) and \"Category 2 (liver)\". ",

When each document was checked, we found a description on respiratory systems that bronchitis and bronchopneumonia lesions are acknowledged within the limits of guidance value of \"Category 1\" in the single inhalation exposure test employing rabbits written in the literature of Sjberg and others (1950), therefore, the GHS classification is appropriate to be \"Category 1.\" Moreover, referring to Duthon (1911), the primary literature of the description of \"anemia and increasing leukocytes\", the description on the blood system is about patients with repeated exposure, who are likely to have been exposed to vanadium compounds other than Vanadium (V) oxide. Therefore, this literature is not adopted and the blood system is excluded from the specific target organs. As for the effects on liver and kidney, according to CICAD, hepatocellular necrosis and opacity expansion of kidney tubulars are observed in the rat study where LD50 value is within the guidance value ranges of \"Category 1\". Therefore, \"Category 1 (liver, kidney)\" is considered to be proper. Based on the above, \"Category 1 (respiratory organs, blood system, liver, kidney)\" is corrected to \"Category 1 (respiratory system, liver, kidney)",
