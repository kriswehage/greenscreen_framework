Additionally, the following animal tests show clear evidences of reproductive toxicity, especially teratogenicity: Repeated i.p. injections resulted in testicular atrophy and decreased spermatogenic activity in mice (IARC vol. 26 (1981) Urogenital malformations, including absence of a kidney, were found in fetuses of rats. This substance was strongly teratogenic (HSDB 2003)); Microcephaly occurred in fetuses from mice orally administered the substance and severe cranial malformations, identified as cranioschisis or encephalocele were often observed (HSDB (2003)).
