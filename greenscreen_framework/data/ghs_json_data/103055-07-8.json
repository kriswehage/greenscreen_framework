In 4-month neurotoxicity tests using rats that underwent oral administration, no abnormalities were detected in groups administered at 27.15 mg/kg/day, which falls under Category 2 guidance doses, in neuropathological examinations; however, pentylenetetrazol-induced convulsions were strengthened and then lessened during recovery tests (Pesticide safety information (Japan Crop Protection Association) (FOOD SANITATION RESEARCH vol.51 No.10 (2001))). According to Pesticide safety information (Japan Crop Protection Association) (FOOD SANITATION RESEARCH vol.51 No.10 (2001))), the following observations have been made: this substance has a high lipid solubility and its degradability in the body is so low that it is presumably accumulated easily in the body, and because this substance promotes pentylenetetrazol-induced convulsions, it presumably acts on the brain stem and cerebral cortex. Consequently, this substance may accumulate in lipid of the cells around the nervous system which is the fatty part of the brain, and when its concentration becomes above a certain level, the substance is considered to impact neurotransmission system. Based on these documents, the substance was classified into Category 2 with its target organs set as the liver and nervous system."
