When the primary literature of this study (Fundam. Appl. Toxicol. 19 (1992)) was thoroughly reviewed, there was a description as follows, \"Although the number of fetuses per litter whose bone structure deformation was observed dose dependently increased compared with the control group, clubbed feet are the most serious bone structure deformation, \"and NTP-CERHR (2000) describes as follows regarding this study, \"There was no deformation other than clubbed feet thet showed statistically significant increase. Wavy ribs as skeletal variants increased in all administered groups.\" Furthermore, there is a description as follows in the study where it was administered in the form of drinking water as sodium salt in 100-600mg/kg to female rats from 2weeks before mating and during the periods of pregnancy and nursing and for 10 weeks to male rats before mating, \"Among females in the highest dose group effects were hardly observed other than decrease in food consumptions and body weight and no histopathological change was observed in males' epididymis, testis, prostate and seminal capsule and non-pregnant females' ovaria, uterus and vagina. When mating with males of the highest dose group, however, conception was delayed and the number of fetuses per litter decreased\" (Patty (5th, 2001)). For the reasons stated above, we classified it as Category 1B.
