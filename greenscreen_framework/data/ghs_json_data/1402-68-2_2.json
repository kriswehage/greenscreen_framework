For other organs besides the liver, in a rat acute oral toxicity test, adrenal haemorrhages, congested lungs and patchy necrosis in the myocardium, kidney and spleen were observed (EHC 11 (1979)).

Additionally, intoxicated cases of children of hepatic encephalopathy in Malaysia were reported (IARC 82 (2002)).
