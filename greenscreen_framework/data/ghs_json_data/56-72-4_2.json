On the other hand, miscarriages were observed in rabbits when doses lethal to parental animals were administered (ACGIH (2007); PATTY, 5th (2001)). Also, in mice, when doses that severely decreased survival rates of parental animals were administered, a decreased number of pregnancies, decreased litter size, and shortened longevity of the offspring were observed. In other words, these adverse effects observed were associated only with high doses that cause mortality in maternal animals, and thus, they were not considered to be the rational for classification.
