No changes were detected in terms of hematological examination items as well as histopathological changes indicative of hematopoietic disorder although decreased hemoglobin concentrations were noted for females in 1000 mg/kg/day groups and lowered hematocrit values were detected for males in all dose groups (100-1000 mg/kg). In addition, no differences were detected between treated and control groups in clinical observations, pathological examinations, and blood biochemistry examinations; and NOEL is reported to be 300 mg/kg (90-day conversion: 100 mg/kg/day) for both sexes (Toxicity Testing Reports of Environmental Chemicals (Chemicals Investigation Promoting Council), accessed in November 2008). In a 4-week repeated oral administration test using rats, no abnormalities were observed in histopathological and clinical examinations other than occult blood reaction detected in urine in the highest dose groups; and NOAEL was 1405 mg/kg/day (90-day conversion: 468 mg/kg/day) (IUCLID (2000)). Overall, since NOEL and NOAEL obtained in these two oral administration tests are above Category 2 guidance values, the substance falls under the \"Not classified\" category (oral route). However, because no test results via other administration routes are available, the substance was classified into the \"Classification not possible\" category."
