Renal lesions were observed at 0.21 mg/kg/day and higher concentrations in both sexes (IRIS (2002)). In rats given phenylmercuric acetate at concentrations of 0.71 - 7.1 mg/kg/day in drinking water for 2-year, pigment deposits were found in the renal cortex and the incidence and severity of age-related chronic nephrosis were increased. The authors suggested that the mechanism of the carcinogenicity could involve the effects of the substance (DFGOT vol. 15 (2001)). Since these renal lesions were noted at dose levels within the guidance value range for Category 1, the substance was classified into Category 1 (kidney). A 39-year-old farmer who had treated seeds with phenylmercuric acetate for 6 \u2013 7 seasons died within several months of developing severe neurological toxicity (ATSDR (1999)). A 39-year-old farmer exposed while dusting oat seeds with the substance, excreted large amounts of mercury in the urine, died of an apparently progressive neurologic disease resembling amylotrophic lateral sclerosis (HSDB (2009)). Based on these case reports of neuropathy where the involvement of the exposure is suggested, the substance was classified into Category 1 (nervous system). There is another exposure case report which describes a swollen mouth, reddened and tender gums, a thin blue line at the gums and carious teeth (ATSDR (1999)), however, these symptoms can not affect the alimentary system severely, therefore the data was not used as the basis of classification. As for effects on the respiratory system, there is a case report where dyspnea and respiratory depression were observed and an autopsy revealed purulent bronchopneumonia. However, it is unclear whether the respiratory effects were direct effects of the phenylmercuric acetate or secondary to the severe neurotoxicity also seen in this subject (ATSDR (1999)). Based on this uncertainty this respiratory system data was not used as the basis of classification.",
