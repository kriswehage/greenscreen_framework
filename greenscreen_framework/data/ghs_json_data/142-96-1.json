In addition, no effects were detected except for elevation in the activities of xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes at 200mg/kg (90-day conversion: 47.6mg/kg) that falls within the Category 2 guidance values (HSDB (2008)). Also, in two other 4-week oral administration tests using rats, noticeable effects were not observed except for activation and elevation of xenobiotics-metabolizing enzymes at both 400mg/kg (90-day conversion: 133mg/kg) and 4,000mg/kg (90-day conversion: 1,333mg/kg) that exceed the range of Category 2 guidance values (RTECS (2007)).

In addition, in inhalation exposure tests using rats, a 4-hour exposure to 20.2mg/L, which exceeds the range of Category 2 guidance values, resulted in effects on the liver and respiratory tracts, and a fatty liver (RTECS (2007)). Furthermore, in mice, an exposure to 10mg/L for 30 minutes (4-hour conversion: 1.25mg/L) resulted in motor ataxia and effects on the lung and respiratory tracts (RTECS (2007)); an exposure to 10mg/L for 75 minutes (4-hour conversion: 3.13mg/L) resulted in narcotic effects, effects on the lung and respiratory tracts, and a fatty liver (RTECS (2007)); and an exposure to 169mg/L for 15 minutes resulted in narcotic effects. Although these data originate from the List 3 literature source, common symptoms were observed in several tests. Therefore, the substance was classified into Category 1 for the respiratory system and liver, and Category 3 for narcotic effects. In addition, an exposure to 200ppm for 15 minutes has been documented to cause irritation to the eyes and nose in humans (HSDB (2008))."
