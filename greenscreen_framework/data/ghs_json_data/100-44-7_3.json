Vapor irritates the respiratory tract, and massive exposure causes pulmonary edema, quadriplegia, unconsciousness, and sometimes death (Initial Environmental Risk Assessment of Chemicals (Ministry of the Environment) vol. 3 (2004)). There is a case report of a worker exposed at 10 mg/m3 who showed asthenia and dysautomonia at the time of health examination (Initial Environmental Risk Assessment of Chemicals (Ministry of the Environment) vol. 3 (2004)). Based on the data, the substance was classified into Category 1 (respiratory tract, nervous system). As for animals, decrease in locomotor activity and sedation were observed in rats following oral administration (Chemical Risk Information Platform (CHRIP) (2008)). Irritative symptoms in the respiratory tract, paralysis and pulmonary edema are reported in cats following inhalation exposure (Initial Risk Assessment Report (NITE, CERI, NEDO) No. 122 (2008)).",
