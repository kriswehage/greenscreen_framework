In addition, in forced oral administration tests using rats (dose: 0 or 5000 mg/kg), no abnormalities were detected in respiration, blood pressure, or electrocardiogram (Pesticide Safety Information (Japan Crop Protection Association) No.18 (1995): The Institute of Environmental Toxicology). These results and the description from the evaluation of this substance that \"its acute toxicity is weak and is equivalent to normal substances\" (Pesticide Safety Information (Japan Crop Protection Association) No.18 (1995): The Institute of Environmental Toxicology) indicate that the substance is to be placed in \"Not classified\" category (oral route). However, due to lack of data on other administration routes, the substance was classified into \"Classification not possible\".",
