However, as for the the change of kidney, liver, a spleen, and a thymus  indicated in Japan Society for Occupational Health Recommendation of Occupational Exposure Limits (1993), since there was no statement in ACGIH (7th, 2001) though it was the same examination, they were not taken as target organ."
