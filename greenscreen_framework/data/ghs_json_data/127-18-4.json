            "rationale": "In a test of 101 dry-cleaning workers who were exposed to the substance, serious disorders in neuropsychological function (sensorimotor response, memory and concentration), autonomic neuropathic symptoms (sensory anesthesia to needle prick, numbness in a limb, rheumatic pain, inebriation and nausea) and personality change such as emotional lability were observed (Hazard Assessment Report (CERI, NITE) (2005)). Based on the data, the substance was classified into Category 1 (nervous system). In an epidemiological test, hepatic dysfunction, liver cirrhosis and hepatomegaly as well as dyspnea, cough and pulmonary edema are reported as findings noted following 3-week to 6-year exposure (Hazard Assessment Report (CERI, NITE) (2005)). Based on the data, the substance was classified into Category 1 (liver, respiratory system). As for the liver, there are reports of fatty infiltration in the liver at 1.356 mg/L/4h following 8-week inhalation (vapour) exposure in rats (EHC 31 (1984)) and centrilobular fatty degeneration at 200 ppm/6h and higher concentrations following 28-day inhalation (vapour) exposure in mice (Initial Risk Assessment Report (NITE, CERI, NEDO) (2006)). Karyomegaly of tubular epithelial cell, kidney cast and nephrosis in the kidney were observed at 100 ppm/6h (0.690 mg/L/6h) and higher concentrations following 2-year inhalation (vapour) exposure in mice (Hazard Assessment Report (CERI, NITE) (2005)). Since these findings were noted at dose levels within the guidance value range for Category 2, the substance was classified into Category 2 (kidney). In conclusion, the substance was classified into Category 1 (nervous system, liver, respiratory system) and Category 2 (kidney).",

            "rationale": "In a test with volunteers, the most frequently reported subjective complaint was central nervous system depression such as light-headedness, dizziness, drowsiness and impaired coordination (EHC 31 (1984)). Acute exposure to the substance by inhalation results in central nervous system depression (IARC 63 (1995)). Based on these reports, the substance was classified into Category 1 (central nervous system). In a report of a death case following exposure to the substance, an autopsy finding of pulmonary edema was noted (Hazard Assessment Report (CERI, NITE) 65 (2005)). In addition, there are case reports of pulmonary congestion following high-concentration exposure (ECETOC TR (1995)). Based on the data, the substance was classified into Category 1 (respiratory system). There is a case report of clouding of consciousness accompanied by hepatic dysfunction occurring 2-3 weeks following exposure (Initial Risk Assessment Report (NITE, CERI, NEDO) 65 (2006)). It was reported that moderate fatty infiltration was noted in the livers of mice after a 4-hour exposure to the substance at concentration of 1,366 mg/L (dose level within the guidance value range for Category 1) (EHC 31 (1984)). Based on the data, the substance was classified into Category 1 (liver). In addition, symptoms of central nervous system depression such as light-headedness, dizziness, drowsiness and impaired coordination, which were reversible, were observed in humans (EHC 31 (1984)). Based on this information, the substance was classified into Category 3 (narcotic effects). In conclusion, the substance was classified into Category 1 (central nervous system, respiratory system, liver) and Category 3 (narcotic effects).",
