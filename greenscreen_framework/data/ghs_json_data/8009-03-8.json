Similarly, the 80-week dermal administration tests using mice that were treated with 25 or 50 mg did not find signs of carcinogenicity (IUCLID (2000)). In addition, according to Patty, the highly refined substance showed little or no signs of carcinogenicity (Patty (5th, 2001)). Referring to the EU classification, the substance of low refinement (yellow, amber, and brown vaseline) is for industrial use, and it sometimes contains polycyclic aromatics that are carcinogenic, and therefore, it is rated as Category 2 (equivalent to Category 1B based on the JIS classification criteria) (EU-Annex 1 (accessed in September 2008)).
