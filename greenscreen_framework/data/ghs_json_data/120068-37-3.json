In dogs, evidence of reduced activity, tremors, convulsions and muscular fasciculations was reported (Agricultural Chemical Registration Data (1995)). These effects were observed at dosing levels within the guidance value ranges for Category 1 (nervous system) and Category 2 (liver and thyroid gland).\n"

Since it cannot be clearly demonstrated that these findings of reproductive effects are secondary, the substance is classified into Category 2 from the viewpoint of safety."
