At autopsy, the heart was found to be dilated, with signs of degenerative changes. Focal haemorrhage and congestion in the lungs were considered to be secondary to heart failure (IARC 47 (1989)). A second report indicates that there had been six deaths suspected due to cardiac disorder in a group of 125 workers exposed for 8 months to 2 years, but there had been no cardiac death or unusual increase in incidence of cardiovascular diseases after use of antimony trisulfide was discontinued (Initial Risk Assessment Report (NITE, CERI, NEDO) (2008)). Based on these findings, the substance was classified into Category 1 (cardiovascular system). As relevant information, there is a report indicating an increase in the incidence of deaths from non-neoplastic respiratory disease after exposure of antimony (Risk assessment report of antimony and antimony compounds (Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare) (2009))."
