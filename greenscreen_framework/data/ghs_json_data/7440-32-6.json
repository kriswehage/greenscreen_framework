Based on this report, titanium dioxide is classified as Category 1 (lung (inhalation)).\nIn acute and subacute administration tests, titanium dioxide did not show toxic effects on the lung (EHC 24 (1982).

In addition, both mutation assays (of Salmonella typhimurium TA98, S. typhimurium TA 100, and Escherichia coli WP2 uvrA) and unscheduled DNA synthesis tests, using the solutions in which the test substances were immersed, gave negative results (HSDB (2003)). Although these tests did not find mutagenic effects of titanium, due to lack of other appropriate test results, classification is not possible.\nAccording to the classification of titanium dioxide by the Japanese Government, both mouse micronucleus tests and mouse chromosomal aberration tests gave negative results (NTP DB, 2005) and thus titanium dioxide was classified into the \"Not classified\" category."

According to the classification by the Japanese Government, titanium dioxide is classified into the \"Not classified\" category.\nTitanium powder (at least 200 mesh) injected intramuscularly in 6, monthly doses, each of which contained 6 mg in trioctanoin, induced 2 fibrosarcomas in 25 male and 25 female rats and lymphosarcomas in 3 male rats (EHC 24, 1982).\nNo signs of carcinogenic effects were found in the following two tests: lead titanate suspended in physiological saline intratracheally administered to guinea pigs once every 3 months six times; and a 5 mg Ti/L concentration of titanium potassium oxalate in drinking water administered to mice during the span of their life (EHC 24, 1982).\nOn the other hand, tianocene was shown to be carcinogenic, when suspended in trioctanoin and injected intramuscularly into rats once a month, to give a total administered dose of 200 mg (EHC 24, 1982). In addition to fibrosarcomas, hepatomas, and malignant lymphomas of the spleen were noted (EHC 24, 1982). Of 50 rats treated with titanium dioxide, only three rats developed a total of three fibrosarcomas (EHC 24, 1982).\nOn the basis of these results, titanium has generally been considered to belong to the group of metals of low carcinogenicity (EHC 24, 1982)."
