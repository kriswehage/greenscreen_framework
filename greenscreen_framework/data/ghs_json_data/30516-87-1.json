Additionally, when rats were treated before mating and throughout gestation and lactation, early embryo mortality was increased and the number of live fetuses per litter and fetal body weight were decreased (IARC vol. 76 (2000)). Based on these information, the substance was classified into Category 2. In addition, since it was reported that in a human test (200 mg, single oral), the substance is distributed into milk and the concentrations in milk were similar to concurrent serum concentrations, the substance was classified as \"Effects on or via lactation\" (JAPIC prescription drug book (2010)).
