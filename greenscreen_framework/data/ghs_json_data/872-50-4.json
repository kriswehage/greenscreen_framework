            "rationale": "In 90-day oral route tests using rats (CICADs (J) No.35, 2001), the NOAEL were 169mg/kg bw (males) and 217mg/kg bw (females). In 28-day oral route tests (CICADs (J) No.35, 2001; DFGOT vol.10, 1998; PATTY 5th, 200, vol.4), the NOAEL documented were 514mg/kg bw (90-day conversion: approx. 160mg/kg bw), 429mg/kg bw (males) (90-day conversion: approx. 133mg/kg bw), 1548mg/kg bw (females) (90-day conversion: approx. 482mg/kg bw); all these values were equivalent to the \"Not classified\" guidance values. In 20-day oral route tests using rabbits (DFGOT vol.10, 1998), no effects were observed on organs. In 13-week inhalation tests using rats (aerosol or mist) (CICADs (J) No.35, 2001; DFGOT vol.10, 1998), the effects on testes and the blood were observed. However, the administration dose was 3mg/L, which was equivalent to the \"Not classified\" guidance values. Similarly, in 4-week inhalation tests (aerosol or mist) (CICADs (J) No.35, 2001; DFGOT vol.10, 1998; PATTY 5th, 200, vol.4), the administration dose (90-day conversion: approx. 0.3mg/L), was equivalent to the \"Not classified\" guidance values. On the other hand, in another 2-week inhalation test using rats (assuming that the substance was in vapour state based on the administration dose of 1.0mg/L) (CICADs (J) No.35, 2001), 90-day conversion value of approx. 0.16mg/L (equivalent to Category 1 guidance values) was associated with reduction and necrosis of the bone marrow cells and the spleen (lymphocytes), necrosis of the liver, multifocal purulent pneumonia, ulceration of glandular stomach, and increased weight of adrenal glands. Moreover, in 5-month inhalation tests (assuming that the substance was in vapour state based on the administration dose of 0.1-0.15mg/L) (DFGOT vol.10, 1998), changes in the lung and kidney were observed at the dose equivalent to the Category 1 guidance values. Thus, the substance was classified into Category 1 (bone marrow, spleen, liver, respiratory system, adrenal gland, and kidney) for inhalation route only.",

In 4-hour inhalation tests using rats, fast and irregular breathing, breathlessness, suppression of pain reflex, and bloody nasal secretion were detected. After the exposure, polypnea and slight blood trace on perinasal hair were observed (CICADs (J) No.35, 2001; DFGOT vol.10, 1998). In addition, in 2-hour inhalation tests using mice, the substance was documented to cause irritation of the eyes and upper airways (DFGOT vol.10, 1998). Based on these results, the substance was classified into Category 3 (respiratory tract irritation).",
