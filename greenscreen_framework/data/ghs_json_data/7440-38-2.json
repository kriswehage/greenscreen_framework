Thus, target organs for these substances are the gastrointestinal tract, heart, brain, and kidney. In addition, the skin, bone marrow and peripheral nervous system are also affected by these substances. Moreover, according to ACGIH (2001), the upper respiratory tract and lung are also affected. Based on these reports, this substance was classified into Category 1 (digestive system, circulatory system, nervous system, kidney, liver, blood system, respiratory system, and skin). As additional background information, the low toxicity of element arsenic is attributed to its virtual insolubility in water or in body fluids (HSDB, 2005).",
