Lymphocytosis, lymph node hyperplasia and atrophy of the olfactory epithelium were also observed at a dose level of 0.0004 mg Ni/L (male and female) (NTP TR454 (1996)).

Lymphoid hyperplasia and atrophy of the olfactory epithelium were observed at a dose level of 0.0005 mg Ni/L (male and female) (at the end of test) (NTP TR454 (1996)). Since these findings in the nasal cavity and lung were noted at dose levels within the guidance value range for Category 1, the substance was classified into Category 1 (respiratory system).

Since these doses fall under Category 1 guidance values, and lesions of the nasal cavity and lung were observed, the substance was classified into Category 1 for its toxic effects on the respiratory system. In addition, in 120-day oral administration tests using male rats, effects on the testes were noted at 25 mg Ni/kg, which falls under Category 2 guidance values; and in 35-day oral administration tests using male mice, atrophy of the seminal vesicles, epididymis, and central part of the vas deferens were observed at 1.1 mg Ni/kg, which falls under Category 1 guidance values.

In experimental animals, these effects were observed at dosing levels within the guidance value ranges for Category 1 and for Category 2. Therefore the substance has been classified as Category 1 (respiratory organs, kidney and testes) and Category 2 (liver). \nThe chronic toxicity of nickel compounds in humans is mentioned as follows: \"Chronic exposure to nickel and its compounds may produce respiratory irritation and degeneration in humans even at doses close to occupational exposure limits.
