Also based on the evidence from animal studies including \"paresis of the hind limbs accompanied by convulsion\" (IUCLID (2000)), \"somnolency, tetany\" (RTECS (2006)). The effects on experimental animals were observed at dosing levels within the guidance value ranges for Category 2.\nThe priority rating of some studies used for the survey of \"epidemiological findings/occupational exposure (human health effects)\" is 2, and the effects are classified into Category 1 (cardiovascular system, muscle), Category 2 (nervous system, kidneys) and Category 3 (respiratory tract irritation, narcotic effects)."
