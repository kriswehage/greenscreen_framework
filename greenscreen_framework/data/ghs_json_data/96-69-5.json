In 13-week and 2-year feeding tests in rats and mice (NTP TR435 (1994)), the following effects were observed: increased serum hepatic enzymes, ALP and GOT levels; histopathological finding in the liver including hypertrophy of Kupffer cells, bile duct hyperplasia, and individual cell necrosis of hepatocytes; hematological changes in erythrocyte count, hemoglobin concentration and hematocrit level; pigmentation and degeneration of the renal cortical tubule epithelial cells; and increase in size and number of macrophages in the mesenteric lymph nodes. These findings were observed at high dose levels exceeding the upper limit of the guidance value range. The effects on the kidney were reported in some tests only, but the effects on the liver were observed in all 5 tests including the 28-day oral test in rats. In the 2-year feeding test in rats, histopathological changes including Kupffer cell hypertrophy, hepatocyte cytoplasmic vacuolization, mixed cell foci, and basophilic foci and remarkable increase in serum GOT were observed at 2500 ppm (100 - 120 mg/kg/day). It is reported that the increases in ALP at dose levels of 1000 ppm (40 - 45 mg/kg/day) and higher are indicative of disturbances involving the hepatobiliary system (NTP TR435 (1994)).
