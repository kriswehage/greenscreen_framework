            "rationale": "In a 2-week inhalation test with rats, congestion of spleen, hemosiderin deposition and extramedullary hematopoiesis were induced at dose levels of 17 - 30 ppm (0.066 - 0.116 mg/L) and higher (EU-RAR (2004)). Decreases in erythrocyte count, hemoglobin concentration and hematocrit and an increase in methemoglobin were observed at 45 ppm (174.2 mg/m3) and higher levels (Hazard Assessment Report (CERI, NITE) (2004)). In a 4-week oral test with rats, onset of erythrotoxicity at 10 mg/kg/day (aniline 4 mg/kg/day) and dose related onset of macrocytic hemolytic anemia and methaemoglobinemia were observed (EU-RAR (2004)). These findings were noted at dose levels within the guidance value range for Category 1. Systemic effects observed in occupationally exposure cases are reported to be cyanosis, headache, dizziness, aphagia, nausea, vomiting, thoracic and abdominal pain, convulsion, weakness, palpitation, irregular respiration, miosis (with response to light), abnormal body temperature and dark urine. Severe cases exhibited pulmonary edema and urinary and fecal incontinence. (Hazard Assessment Report (CERI, NITE) No. 63 (2004)) Increased methemoglobin is also reported (DFGOT vol. 6 (1994)). Based on the data, the substance was classified into Category 1 (blood system, systemic toxicity).",

            "rationale": "Acute intoxication due to the formation of methemoglobin, resulting in cyanosis and possible death from asphyxiation, was the most frequent consequence of overexposure to the substance (ACGIH (2001)). In humans, dizziness, coma, miosis, confusion, pallor, cyanosis, dyspnea, degeneration in the heart, liver and kidney, edemas in the lung and brain, and hemorrhage in the medulla oblongata are reported following accidental ingestions, suicide attempts or occupational exposures. The type of symptom depends on the methemoglobin content of total hemoglobin (Hazard Assessment Report (CERI, NITE) No. 63 (2004)). Formation of methemoglobin was confirmed in suicide cases and human volunteers. In humans, the main effect of analine exposure is formation of methemoglobin in blood, and the subsequent systemic symptoms reported above. The substance was classified into Category 1 (blood system). In acute exposure animal tests, clinical signs included tremors, cyanosis and lethargy in rats (EU-RAR (2004)) and formation of methaemoglobin leading to cyanosis in cats (EU-RAR (2004)).",
