            "rationale": "An inhalation exposure (1 mg/m3/6h, 4-hour equivalence: 0.0058 mg/L) to a 12% preparation of the substance produced only minimal pulmonary edema in guinea pigs (ACGIH (2001)). In a test where 5 rats were exposed to a subtilisin, Alcalase (0.1 to 0.4 mg aep/L/4h) (OECD TG403), pulmonary oedema together with lung congestion and haemorrhage was observed (HERA (2007)). In addition, there is a report of \"the subtilisins are known primary respiratory tract irritants\" (ACGIH (2001)). Based on the data, the substance was classified into Category 1 (respiratory system).",
