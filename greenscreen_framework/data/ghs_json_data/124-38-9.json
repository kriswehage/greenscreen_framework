                "In human exposure tests at 1.5% for a period of 42 days during exercise, mild evidence of stress reactions was apparent, but there were no measurable decrease in basic physiological functions or in psychomotor performance (ACGIH (2001)). In a test where submarine volunteers were exposed at 1% carbon dioxide for 22 days, only metabolic stress was indicated (ACGIH (2001)). Additionally, it is reported that deepened respiration was reported at 2%, respiratory resistance increased with elevation of carbon dioxide concentration and concentrations in excess of 3% was not well tolerated (ACGIH (2001)). Exposures at 3% in World War II submarines initially led to brief periods of excitation, followed by progressive depression, and subsequently cutaneous blood flow increased, core body temperature fell, blood pressure fell, and the rate of blood flow increased. Other indices of circulatory function were depressed, the rate of breathing was slowed, and mental functions were impaired (PATTY (5th, 2001)). Additionally, there is a report that acidosis and adrenal cortical exhaustion occur as the result of prolonged, continuous exposure to an atmosphere containing 1 to 2% carbon dioxide (ACGIH (2001)). The available information in respect to repeat exposure is limited and most of the data is obsolete. The findings lack consistency except for slight effects, therefore classification was not possible due to lack of data."

Case reports for two men who suddenly became unconscious from excessive carbon dioxide exposure are available. The reports indicate that repeated eye examinations showed constriction of visual fields, enlargement of blindspots, and photophobia. Headache, insomnia, and personality changes were also reported (HSDB (2008)). These symptoms were attributed to damage to retinal ganglion cells and central nervous system. Additionally, it is reported that exposure at 11% carbon dioxide can cause dysregulation and unconsciousness within 10 min, and exposure at 25 - 30 % can cause respiratory arrest, fall in blood pressure, loss of coma reflex, loss of sensation and death within a few hour (Japanese journal of industrial health vol. 15 No.3 (1974))."

Defects of vertebral column occurred in 16/17 fetuses (1/30 in control) following exposure to rabbits between 7th and 12th day of gestation. Additionally, there is a report that ectrodactyly was observed in mice. However, these results are insufficient for classification since exposure concentrations were too high and there is no data for fertility. Classification was not possible due to lack of data."
