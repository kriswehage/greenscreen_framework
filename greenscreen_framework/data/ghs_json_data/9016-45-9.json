However, 250 mg/kg/day is not within the limits of the guidance value of \"Category 2.\" Therefore, liver is not included in the specific target organ for repeated exposure. Moreover, according to the paper by Smyth and Calandra (1969), focal necrosis of heart muscle was observed not only in the dogs but in the guinea pig as well. In the NPE20 oral administration study using dogs, focal myocardial necrosis is observed in the group receiving 0.20g/kg/day (34-day administration) and the group receiving 0.04g/kg/day (90-day administration), and both doses are within the guidance value ranges of \"Category 2\" after conversion during the dosing period. In the public comments, it is pointed out that GHS classification should be considered by dividing the substance into E.O. add. mols, but there is no limit to E.O. add. mols determined for this substance, \"poly (oxypropylene) = nonylphenyl ether\" and classification for the most hazardous substance must be adopted. Therefore, since focal myocardial necrosis is observed within the guidance value ranges equivalent to \"Category 2\" in the NPE20 oral administration study using dogs, it is considered proper to be defined as \"Category 2 (cardiovascular system)\", if based on GHS classification.
