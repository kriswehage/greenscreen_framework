Based on the data, the substance was classified into Category 2 (lung). In a learning ability test with rats by oral administration for 77 days, rate of lever pressing in rats treated with 20 mg Ni/kg bw/day which is within the guidance value range for Category 2, was lower than that in the controls. According to the authors, the reduced rate of lever pressing could be caused by decreases in fundamental sensory, coordinated movement and motivation due to nickel exposure (Initial Risk Assessment Report (NITE, CERI, NEDO) ver. 1.0 No. 115 (2008)). In a 90-day oral dose test in rats, mortality was 100% at 100 mg/kg/day, which is the upper limit of the guidance value range for Category 2. Decolorized tip of fur, salivation, loss of coordination, irregular respiration, hypothermia and lethargy were observed in both sexes in this dose level (Initial Risk Assessment Report (NITE, CERI, NEDO) ver. 1.0 No. 115 (2008)). In addition, effects of soluble inorganic nickel on the central nervous system are suggested in ACGIH classification (ACGIH TLV-Basis-Critical Effects: Central Nervous System; ACGIH-TLV (2004)). The substance was classified into Category 2 (central nervous system).",

Based on these results, the substance was classified into Category 2 (lung). In addition, in a 77-day learning ability test, fewer rats given 20 mg Ni/kg/day administration, which falls under Category 2 guidance values, pushed the lever compared with control groups. According to the author, decreased frequency of pushing the lever is attributed to reduced basic perception, decreased coordinated movement, or loss of achievement motivation (Initial Risk Assessment Report (NITE, CERI, NEDO) ver. 1.0, No. 115, 2008). In a 90-day oral administration test using rats, a 100% mortality and symptoms such as discoloration of the tip of the fur, salivation, loss of coordination, irregular respiration, hypothermia, and lethargy were noted in both sexes exposed to 100 mg/kg/day concentration, which is the upper limit of Category 2 guidance values, by the end of the experiment (Initial Risk Assessment Report (NITE, CERI, NEDO) ver. 1.0, No. 115, 2008). Existing evaluation by ACGIH indicate that soluble inorganic nickel affects the central nervous system (ACGIH TLV-basis critical effects: central nervous system; ACGIH-TLV, 2004).
