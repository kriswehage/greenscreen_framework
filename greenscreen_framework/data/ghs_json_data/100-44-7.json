Medical examination of these workers revealed liver function disorders with increased serum bilirubin levels. Neurological symptoms such as tremor were also observed (DFGOT vol. 6 (1994)). In a 26-week oral test (3 times weekly) in mice, moderate to severe hyperplasia was observed in the liver (Initial Environmental Risk Assessment of Chemicals (Ministry of the Environment) vol. 4 (2005)). Based on the data (of human cases primarily), the substance was classified into Category 1 (liver, nervous system). In a 3-week inhalation test in mice, severe lesions in respiratory epithelium and olfactory epithelium were observed at 240 mg/m3 (90-day equivalent: 40 mg/m3/6h) (Initial Environmental Risk Assessment of Chemicals (Ministry of the Environment) vol. 4 (2005)).

Since these findings were noted at dose levels within the guidance value range for Category 1, the substance was classified into Category 1 (respiratory system). In a 26-week oral test (3 times weekly) in rats, necrosis of myocardium was observed in the females at 62 mg/kg/day and higher levels. In an oral test in rats (male: 37 weeks, female: 27 weeks), significantly increased incidences of hyperplasia and focal necrosis of myocardium were observed in both sexes at 62 mg/kg/day (Initial Environmental Risk Assessment of Chemicals (Ministry of the Environment) vol. 4 (2005)). Based on the data, the substance was classified into Category 2 (heart). Degeneration in the thyroid gland noted in the males of 30 mg/kg/day group in a 2-year oral test (3 times weekly) with rats was accompanied by increased incidence of thyroid tumor.
