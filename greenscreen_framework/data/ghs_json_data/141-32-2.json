Additional clinical signs at 12.1 - 16.0 mg/L were dyspnea, trembling and closed eyelids. Deaths occurred at 6.8 mg/L and higher concentrations (SIDS (2009)). In a second inhalation test (LC50: 8.08 mg/L), lungs were congested in victims and survivors had pneumonia (SIDS (2009)). In a third inhalation test (LC50: 13.3 mg/L), clinical signs included agitation, dyspnoea, hyperaemia of the nasal and ocular mucosa, pulmonary haemorrhages, pulmonary oedema, and emphysema (ECETOC JACC 27 (1994)). In an acute oral toxicity test, labored breathing and prone position were observed at a high dose level and autopsy of victims revealed hemorrhagic lungs (SIDS (2009)). Since these adverse effects on the lung and respiratory tract were observed at dose levels within the guidance value range for Category 1, the substance was classified into Category 1 (respiratory system).",
