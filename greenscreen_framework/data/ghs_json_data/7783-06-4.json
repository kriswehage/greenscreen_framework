And unconsciousness and respiratory paralysis resulting in deaths (IRIS, 2006), and decrease in conditioned avoidance response and tissue damage to airway mucosa were observed after a single exposure inhalation at the dosage within the guidance values of Category 1 in rats, and mild irritation to nasal mucosa was observed after a single exposure inhalation in mice (CICAD, 2003)."
