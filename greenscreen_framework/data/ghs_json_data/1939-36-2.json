Similarly, in 29-day oral administration tests using rats, effects on the gastrointestine were observed, but the TDLo is 21000 mg/kg/29 days (90-day correction dose: approximately 233 mg/kg/day), which falls under the guidance values of \"Not classified\" category.

Based on these test results (all of which were cited from RTECS, 2000: the original literature is OTS0546344, the National Technical Information Service (NTIS)), the substance is considered to be rated as \"Not classified\".
