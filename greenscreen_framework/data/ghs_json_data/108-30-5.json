                "Rat or mouse tests have been conducted in which oral administration was repeated for 13 weeks or 2 years (NTP TR373 (1990). In the 13-week administration tests, mortality occurred at high doses in both rats and mice, but at lower doses (100mg/kg/day for rats and 150mg/kg/day for mice), no specific findings were noted in clinical observations, autopsy, and histopathological examinations other than lowered average body weight and gastritis in male mice which seemed to be a localized effect (NTP TR373 (1990)). Furthermore, in the 2-year administration tests, in which highest doses administered were 100mg/kg/day for rats and 75 (males) to 150mg/kg/day (females) for mice, decreased average body weight was detected. However, these doses did not affect survival rates compared with that of the control groups and in the case of males, survival rates of treated mice significantly increased. In addition, histopathologically speaking, frequencies of neoplastic lesions or non-neoplastic lesions did not increase regardless of administration of this substance (NTP TR373 (1990)).  \nThese results show that no severe toxic effects were observed with dosages that are equivalent to the upper limit of the guidance values in either rat or mouse repeated oral administration tests for 13 weeks or 2 years, and therefore the substance should be classified into the \"Not classified\" category. However, due to lack of data on other administration routes, it was classified into the \"Classification not possible\" category in conclusion.\n"
