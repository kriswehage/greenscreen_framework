Furthermore, in the 2-year administration tests, in which highest doses administered were 100mg/kg/day for rats and 75 (males) to 150mg/kg/day (females) for mice, decreased average body weight was detected. However, these doses did not affect survival rates compared with that of the control groups and in the case of males, survival rates of treated mice significantly increased. In addition, histopathologically speaking, frequencies of neoplastic lesions or non-neoplastic lesions did not increase regardless of administration of this substance (NTP TR373 (1990)).  \nThese results show that no severe toxic effects were observed with dosages that are equivalent to the upper limit of the guidance values in either rat or mouse repeated oral administration tests for 13 weeks or 2 years, and therefore the substance should be classified into the \"Not classified\" category.
