The main symptoms of acute intoxication were central nervous symptoms and kidney damage (DFGOT VII (1992)). There is a case report of damage in the kidney in a person who was exposed to paint containing the substance (DFGOT VII (1992), BUA report 204 (1977)). However, in this human exposure case, it was suggested that the damage was due to a synergistic effect with alcohol rather than a direct effect of the substance (DFGOT VII (1992)). As for the results of the rabbit test, since information regarding the type and severity of the kidney damage is lacking, and details are not clear, this data was not used for classification. The substance was classified into Category 2 (central nervous system).",

In addition, damage to the central nervous system and kidneys is documented as acute symptoms of this substance (DFGOT vol. 7 (1992)). Although kidney damage in humans who were exposed to paint containing this substance has been documented (DFGOT vol. 7 (1992), BUA report 204 (1997)), the damage was thought to be caused by the synergistic action of alcohol and not by direct effects of the substance itself (DFGOT vol. 7 (1992)). In rabbit studies, no details, such as types and extent of kidney damage, have been documented. Thus, in terms of the kidney, classification is not possible, and in terms of the central nervous system, it was classified into Category 2."

Since no adverse effects on reproductive functions and fertility of parents and development of the offspring were observed, the substance was classified into \"Not classified\".
