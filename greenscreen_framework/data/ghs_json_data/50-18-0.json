For humans, it was reported that there was an increase in the number of chromosomal aberrations in the peripheral blood lymphocytes of children treated with cyclophosphamide for nonmalignant conditions. A similar effect in the peripheral blood lymphocytes was found in patients with rheumatoid arthritis following cyclophosphamide treatment. At 3 or 24-hour after an i.v. administration of cyclophosphamide, patients with recurrent ovarian or uteral carcinoma exhibited similar lymphocytes effects. Changes in bone marrow and lymph-node cells of patients with lymphogranulomatosis were observed at 24 - 72-hour after a single dose of cyclophosphamide (IARC 26 (1981)).",
