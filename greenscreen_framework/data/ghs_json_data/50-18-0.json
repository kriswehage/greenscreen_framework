Since impaired liver function and jaundice are reported as significant side effects while the incidence is not specified (JAPIC prescription drug book (2010)), the substance was classified into Category 1 (liver). Additionally, it was reported that administration of the substance can cause anaphylactoid reaction, hemorrhagic cystitis, and oculomucocutaneous syndrome (Stevens-Johnson syndrome), however, frequencies are not specified. The substance can also cause ileus, gastrointestinal hemorrhage and interstitial pneumonia at a frequency of 0.1 - 0.5% or less (JAPIC prescription drug book (2010)). Since these symptoms are considered to involve the immune system, but the affected organ cannot be identified, the substance was classified into Category 1 (immune system, systemic toxicity).

For humans, it was reported that there was an increase in the number of chromosomal aberrations in the peripheral blood lymphocytes of children treated with cyclophosphamide for nonmalignant conditions. A similar effect in the peripheral blood lymphocytes was found in patients with rheumatoid arthritis following cyclophosphamide treatment. At 3 or 24-hour after an i.v. administration of cyclophosphamide, patients with recurrent ovarian or uteral carcinoma exhibited similar lymphocytes effects. Changes in bone marrow and lymph-node cells of patients with lymphogranulomatosis were observed at 24 - 72-hour after a single dose of cyclophosphamide (IARC 26 (1981))."
