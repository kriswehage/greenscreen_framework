            "rationale": "In acute oral toxicity tests with rats and mice (LD50 values: 830 - 1600 mg/kg for rats, 390 mg/kg for mice), administration resulted in labored breathing and central nervous system depression, preceded by incoordination, ataxia and reduced motor activity (PATTY (5th, 2001)). Central nervous system depression is also reported in an inhalation test in mice (vapour: 0.96 - 3.6 mg/L) (Initial Risk Assessment Report (NITE, CERI, NEDO) (2005)). Since the dose levels were within the guidance value range, the substance was classified into Category 1 (central nervous system). In the above oral toxicity tests, occasionally the liver showed focal areas of necrosis (PATTY (5th, 2001)). In an acute inhalation toxicity test with mice (LC50 value: 270 ppm/4h (1.3 mg/L/4h)), occasionally, hepatic focal inflammatory cells and moderate congestion were observed (PATTY (5th, 2001)). Since the inhalation dose level was within the guidance value range for Category 1, the substance was classified into Category 1 (liver). In an acute inhalation toxicity test with mice (LC50 value: 270 ppm/4h (1.3 mg/L/4h)), lung irritation and pneumonitis was confirmed by microscopic examination (PATTY (5th, 2001)). In rats, pulmonary edema was observed at 500 ppm/7h (2.334 mg/L/4h) and higher doses following inhalation exposure (Initial Risk Assessment Report (NITE, CERI, NEDO) (2005)). Additionally, in another inhalation test in mice (vapour: 0.96 - 3.6 mg/L), severe irritative symptoms including dyspnea was noted (Initial Risk Assessment Report (NITE, CERI, NEDO) (2005)). Based on the data, the substance was classified into Category 1 (respiratory system). In an inhalation test in rats, congestion in the kidney was observed at 300 ppm/7h (1.8 mg/L/4h) (Initial Risk Assessment Report (NITE, CERI, NEDO) (2005)), and it is reported that \"main target organ following acute oral or dermal exposure is kidney\" (PATTY (5th, 2001)). Therefore, the substance was classified into Category 1 (kidney).",
