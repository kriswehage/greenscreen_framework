In addition, in a 31-day oral administration test using rats, no toxic effects were noted other than delayed body weight gain at 375, 750, and 1500 mg/kg bw/day (90-day conversion: 125, 250, and 500 mg/kg bw/day, respectively), which are above Category 2 guidance values (BUA Report No. 126 (1993)). These results indicate that the substance falls under the \"Not classified\" category (oral route); however, due to lack of information on other administration routes, the substance was classified into the \"Classification not possible\" category. As additional notes, in a 13-week oral administration test using rats, effects of administration on the liver and blood are reported (RTECS (2006)); however, the test dose and duration were 9100 mg/kg/13 weeks, and this study is documented in the List 3 data source.
