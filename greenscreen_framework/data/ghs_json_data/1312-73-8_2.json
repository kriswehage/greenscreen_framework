In light of these reports, the substance was classified into Category 2 (respiratory system).\nNotes: This substance reacts with water to produce hydrogen sulfide. According to Japan's GHS classification, single inhalation exposure to hydrogen sulfide (ID998) in humans can cause nausea, headaches, delirium, a disturbed equilibrium, poor memory, neutrobehavioral changes, olfactory paralysis, loss of consciousness, tremors, convulsions, cardiac arrhythmias, increase in blood pressure (CICAD, 2003), loss of consciousness, and respiratory paralysis leading to death (IRIS, 2006). In rats that underwent single inhalation exposure to hydrogen sulfide at concentrations that are in the range of Category 1 guidance values, conditioned avoidance behavior was suppressed and histological damage to respiratory tract and olfactory mucosa was observed. And in mice underwent single inhalation exposure to hydrogen sulfide, mild irritation to nasal mucosa was noted (CICAD, 2003). Based on these reports, hydrogen sulfide is classified into Category 1 (central nervous system, cardiovascular system, and respiratory system).",
