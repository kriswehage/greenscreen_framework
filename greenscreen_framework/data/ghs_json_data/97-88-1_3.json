Therefore, based on this oral administration study in rats, it was judged that the lien should not be included in the specific target organs for repeated exposure. Moreover, according to Hagan et al's (1993) inhalation exposure test using rats, no effects on the lien were observed. Since the values in the other organs are within the guidance value ranges of \"Category 2\"in both species tests and no significant toxic effects have not been seen, it is proper to be classified as \"Not classified\" if based on GHS classification.
