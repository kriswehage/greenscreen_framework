Effects including small testicles, curtailment of spermatogenic activity, and immature prostate were observed (IRIS (2002)). Also, in a diet feeding test using rats, even at high doses where general toxic effects such as discolored liver lobes, elevated absolute and relative liver and kidney weights were observed, no treatment-related effects on behavior, appearance, growth rate, food consumption, hematology, or urinalysis were found (IRIS (2002)).
