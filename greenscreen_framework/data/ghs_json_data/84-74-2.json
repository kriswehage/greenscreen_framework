It is appropriate to delete the testis from the target organs, because the fact that with repeated exposure there are negative effects on male reproductive functions, already included under reproductive toxicity, would end up being covered twice, and it does not match the GHS definition. Moreover, in inhalation exposure test using rats, not only dosage dependent mucilage cell hyperplasia in the nasal cavity but also dosage dependent squamous metaplasia in the larynx are observed.
