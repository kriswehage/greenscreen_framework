Long-term exposure, bladder stones, kidney damage, and infrequent liver damage were also observed in some studies (PATTY (5th, 2001)). However, these symptoms were associated with much higher doses than the cutoff value of the guidance range (100mg/kg/day). In humans, several epidemiological studies have been conducted, which revealed many cases of death, progressive kidney damage followed by kidney failure, and a few cases of liver damage (DFGOT vol. 10 (1998)).
