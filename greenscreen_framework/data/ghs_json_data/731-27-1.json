In these tests, dose-dependent mortality rates were not detected although reduced body-weight gain was observed (JMPR (2002)). In one of the rat tests, only malignant uterine tumours appeared at higher incidence in all treated groups as compared with controls. Because these tumors develop under normal circumstances, it is reported that the difference observed was likely to be attributed to low incidences of tumor development in control groups (JMPR (2002)). In the other rat test, thyroid follicular-cell adenomas were observed in animals treated with the highest dose (7500 ppm). The probable cause of adenoma was related to the increased concentrations of the thyroid stimulating hormone and alterations in the thyroid feedback mechanism, so the concentration levels that do not affect the thyroid gland would not induce carcinogenicity in humans (JMPR (2002)). With regard to mice, hepatocellular adenomas and pulmonary adenomas were observed in both treated and control groups, and incidences of tumor development due to exposure to the substance did not increase in either mouse tests (JMPR (2002)). Thus, since the rat and mouse tests conducted twice did not show evidence of carcinogenicity, the substance was classified into \"Not classified\".",
