In addition, there is a report that the target organ of the substance is the cardiovascular system; it causes dilation of peripheral blood vessels which results in very marked reductions in blood pressure (DFGOT vol. 20 (2003)). Based on the data, the substance was classified into Category 1 (cardiovascular system). In above cases, dizziness, lipothymia, altered mental status, noncardiac pulmonary edema and metabolic acidosis were also observed. In a human suicide case by the ingestion of several grams of the substance, pulmonary edema and brain edema were the finding at autopsy (ACGIH (2001)). Based on the data, the substance was classified into Category 1 (lung, central nervous system, systemic toxicity). In rats, decreased heart rate and generalized convulsions were observed following oral administration (DFGOT vol. 20 (2003)). In rabbits, an oral dose caused reduction in blood pressure and cardiac irregularities (PATTY (5th, 2001)).",
