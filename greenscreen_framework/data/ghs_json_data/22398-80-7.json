The substance caused inflammation at the base of the epiglottis of the larynx and hyperplasia of the bronchial lymph nodes (NTP TR499 (2001)). In addition, exposure to the substance affected the circulating erythroid mass, and induced a microcytic erythrocytosis consistent with bone marrow hyperplasia and hematopoietic cell proliferation of the spleen (NTP TR499 (2001)). Since these findings were observed at exposure concentrations within the guidance value range for Category 1 or 2, the substance was classified into Category 1 (respiratory system, hematopoietic system). Hepatocellular necrosis was suggested by increased serum activities of alanine aminotransferase and was confirmed microscopically at a concentration of 0.1 mg/L (within the guidance value range for Category 2) in the 14-week inhalation test in rats, therefore, the substance was classified into Category 2 (liver). Additionally, there is a report that the substance caused obvious testicular damage in a test where hamsters were observed for approximately two years following intratracheal instillations of 3.0 mg/kg. Decreases in male reproductive organ weight and caudal sperm count, and severe histopathologic changes in the testes were also found (Japan Society For Occupational Health (JSOH) Recommendations for allowable concentrations (2007))."
