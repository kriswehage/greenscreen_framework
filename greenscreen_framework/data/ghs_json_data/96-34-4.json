Autopsy of the animals which had died gave findings such as liver, spleen and kidneys coloured deep brown, dilatation of the heart, congestive hyperaemia, and bloody corrosive gastritis (BUA 150 (1994)). In rat inhalation acute toxicity tests, the animals showed intoxication symptoms such as impairment of the respiratory system and of coordinated movements and reflexes, an increased tendency to clean themselves, red incrusted noses and cyanosis, in addition to non-specific symptoms such as prone position and disorders of balance (DFGOT Vol. 9 (1998)). Autopsy of the animals which had died showed changes in the lungs and gastro-intestinal tract (BUA 150 (1994)). In dermal acute toxicity tests with rats and rabbits, the animals showed skin symptoms such as erythema and oedema, and autopsy of the animals which had died showed redness of the small intestine with injected blood vessels, as well as deep brown coloured livers (BUA 150 (1994)). Following oral and dermal application, autopsy of the surviving animals showed no abnormalities macroscopically, but following inhalation exposure, enlargement and coloured of the lungs was observed (BUA 150 (1994)). From the LD50 values (oral: 107 - 140 mg/kg, dermal: 136 - 318 mg/kg, inhalation: 0.945 - 1.418 mg/L), the toxic effects were observed at dose levels within the guidance value range for Category 1. However, the affected organ cannot be identified and the information are reported in a document in List 2, so the substance was classified into Category 2 (systemic toxicity). In addition, based on a report that concentrations of 210 ppm or more led to severe irritation of the respiratory tract (DFGOT vol. 9 (1998)), the substance was classified into Category 3 (respiratory tract irritation)."
