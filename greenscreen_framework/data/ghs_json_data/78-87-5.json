In addition, an increase in the frequencies of bronchiolar / alveolar carcinomas in female mice was noted, indicating that the substance is carcinogenic to female mice (Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (Results from Carcinogenicity Studies), 2005). On the other hand, carcinogenicity tests through oral administration using rats found no clear increase in the frequency of tumors was noted. Overall, carcinogenicity studies using mice that received oral administration resulted in an increase in the frequencies of hepatic adenomas and liver carcinomas, which supports the evidence that there is a neoplastic response in the mouse liver for both sexes (NTP TR 263, 1988).
