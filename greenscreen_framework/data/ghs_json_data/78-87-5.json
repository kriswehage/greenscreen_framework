In addition, an increase in the frequencies of bronchiolar / alveolar carcinomas in female mice was noted, indicating that the substance is carcinogenic to female mice (Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (Results from Carcinogenicity Studies), 2005). On the other hand, carcinogenicity tests through oral administration using rats found no clear increase in the frequency of tumors was noted.
