In addition, based on a case report that ingestion led to the formation of cataracts in a human (DFGOT vol. 11 (1998)) and reports that rabbits administered orally (1000 - 3000 mg/kg) developed cataracts (ACGIH (7th, 2001)) or corneal opacity (DFGOT vol. 11 (1998)), the substance was classified into Category 1 (eye). Similar damage to the respiratory tract was observed in mice subjected to inhalation exposure for 4-hour at concentrations of 0.1 - 0.35 mg/L (DFGOT vol. 11 (1998), IARC 82 (2002), EHC 202 (1998)). Based on the data, the substance was classified into Category 1 (respiratory tract). In an oral test in mice, administration produced injury (swelling, vacuolation, exfoliation, necrosis) of the tracheobronchial epithelial Clara cells at dose levels within the guidance value range for Category 2 (400 mg/kg) (NTP TR 500 (2000)).
