In some of the case reports reported above, hemoglobinuria, cyanosis and methemoglobinemia were also reported mainly in infant cases (DFGOT vol. 20 (2003), PATTY (5th, 2001)), therefore, the substance was classified into Category 1 (blood system). Effects in the respiratory and cardiovascular systems were not reported. Findings of dyspnea, tachycardia and decreased blood pressure, which were used for the former classification, were attributed to cyanosis due to methemoglobinemia. For rats, signs of intoxication after oral administration included shivering, twitching and tonic-clonic seizures (CICADs 71 (2006)).",
