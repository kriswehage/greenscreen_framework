Inhalation challenge tests with the substance in three of the five workers reproduced their symptoms and resulted in both immediate and delayed responses. Immunologic studies did not demonstrate specific antibodies; however, clinical signs suggested a hypersensitivity reaction rather than an irritant effect. The presence of IgE antibody specific to the substance was later reported in seven female workers exposed to the chemical via an epoxy resin; the antibody was identified following skin-prick and radioallergosorbent tests (radioactive allergen absorption test).
