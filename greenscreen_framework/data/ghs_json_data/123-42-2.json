                "In rats, a hemolytic action persisted for several days after a single 2 mL/kg (1860 mg/kg) administration by gavage. The liver showed increased numbers of lymphocytes, followed by cloudy swelling, vacuolization, and granulation of the cytoplasm (ACGIH (2001)). Since the dose level is within the guidance value range for Category 2, the substance was classified into Category 2 (blood system, liver). Inhalation exposure of mice, rats, rabbits, and cats for 1 to 3-hour produced somnolence after a period of restlessness and excitability (ACGIH (2001)). The substance is primarily a narcotic and anticonvulsant (ACGIH (2001)). The primary systemic effect is a narcotic effect (PATTY (5th, 2001)). Based on these reports, the substance was classified into Category 3 (narcotic effects). In a human test, vapour exposure at 100 ppm for 15 minutes produced nose and throat irritation in most subjects. In another test, humans exposed to 400 ppm for 15 minutes experienced pulmonary discomfort, nose and throat irritation (PATTY (5th, 2001)). Based on the data, the substance was classified into Category 3 (respiratory tract irritation). There is a report of the development of a nephrotic syndrome in a 59-year-old man 40 days after a 3-day exposure to diacetone alcohol and ethanol paint solvents. In this case, renal biopsy gave evidence of a proliferative glomerulonephritis (PATTY (5th, 2001)). This data was not used as the basis of classification since the effect was reported only in one case and it was induced by exposure to a mixture of solvents and there is no report for association with the substance exposure.",

Since the anesthetic actions was seen in the animal (ACGIH (2001), PATTY (5th, 2001)), it is classified into Category 3."
