In workers who were occupationally exposed to vinyl chloride (compensation cases in Japan), poisoning symptoms, including dizziness, photophobia, vomiting and disorientation were observed following acute exposure, and severe arrhythmia, collapse, unconsciousness and sometimes death were observed following acute, high dose exposure (July 29, 1976, Kihatu No. 556). Based on the data, the substance was classified into Category 1 (central nervous system). There is a report that the main symptoms after a single exposure are narcotic effects (DFGOT vol. 5 (1993)).

The number of resorbed fetuses was significantly increased in rats exposed during day 1 - 9 of gestation (SIDS (access on May 2009)). Based on these data, the substance was classified into Category 2. In humans, it was reported that exposure of the substance caused male reproductive dysfunction (Initial Risk Assessment Report (NITE, CERI, NEDO) No. 75 (2005)). In an epidemiological test for congenital malformations, the rate of malformations for the three communities having PCV production plants was significantly higher than that in control areas. The greatest excess included malformations of the CNS, cleft lip and palate, and club foot (SIDS (access on May 2009)). However, the result was not used as the basis for the determination of classification since there is a report that the test data are not sufficient for a clear evaluation of human reproductive toxicity (EHC 215 (1999)).",
