Rabbits exposed to 100% oxygen showed decreased lung capacity, decreased phospholipids (surfactant), and pulmonary edema after 24 - 96-hour (PATTY (5th, 2001)). In rats, a 12-hour exposure to 95% oxygen caused a decline in surfactant (PATTY (5th, 2001)). All reported effects appeared at dose levels exceeding the guidance value range. In humans, cough occurred after a <=4-hour exposure to 95% oxygen (PATTY (5th, 2001)). Cough occurred within 3-hour after exposure to 90 - 95% oxygen (HSDB (2007)). Based on the data, the substance was classified into Category 3 (respiratory tract irritation). Symptoms such as impairment of visual fields and visual acuity were reported in humans in association with hyperbaric oxygen (PATTY (5th, 2001)). Oxygen intoxication is notorious in the medical/submarine medical fields, however this intoxication occurs after atypical oxygen exposure under unusual situations, and is considered to be out of range of GHS Hazard Communication.",

However, these observations were made at doses higher than the range of guidance values. In humans, exposure to 95% concentration of oxygen was associated with coughing within 4 hours (PATTY (5th, 2001)). Similarly, exposure to 90-95% concentrations of oxygen was associated with coughing within 3 hours (HSDB (2007)). From these human results, the substance was classified into Category 3 (respiratory tract irritation). Transient impairment of visual fields and visual acuity have been reported in association with hyperbaric O2 (PATTY (5th, 2001))."
