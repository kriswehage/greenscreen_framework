Furthermore, heart-related symptoms such as tachycardia, difficulty in breathing, and cyanosis were observed. This description is consistent with the documented case in which a 36-year-old healthy male pilot suffered from cardiac arrest after taking an over-the-counter supplement that included Ma-huang.
