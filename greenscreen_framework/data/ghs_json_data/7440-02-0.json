Based on the data, the substance was classified into Category 1 (respiratory system).

In a 21-month inhalation exposure test in rats, pleuritis, pneumonia, congestion and edema were observed at a dose level of 15 mg/m3 (0.015 mg/L) which is within the guidance value range for Category 1 (CaPSAR (1994)).
