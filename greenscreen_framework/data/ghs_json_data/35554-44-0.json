In 14-week (3-month) oral administration tests using rats, hepathocellular necrosis was documented at the concentration of 800 ppm (90-day conversion value: 40 mg/kg) (HSDB (2006)). Furthermore, in 3-month oral administration tests using mice, an increased incidence of dark livers was identified at the highest doses (male: 140 mg/kg/day, and female: 170 mg/kg) and the middle doses for males (53 mg/kg/day); histological examination showed an increase in the numbers of small and large vacuoles, especially in the periportal area in both sexes (JMPR No. 8 (2000)). In summary, in oral exposure tests using rats or mice, the effects of exposure on the liver, such as necrosis of hepatocytes, were found in the range of doses that are comparable to Category 2 guidance values.

In reproductive toxicity tests using rats that were in compliance with OECD guidelines, besides reduced body weight in maternal animals, no significant differences were noticed compared with control animals in terms of pregnancy rates, the number of corpora lutea and implantation rates. Furthermore, in above-mentioned tests, in which developmental toxicity tests were also conducted, no signs of teratogenicity were detected in fetuses, while the number of embryos and fetuses along with fetal body weight decreased (JMPR No. 12 (2005)). Overall, while no reports on general toxicity on parental animals are available, a decrease in survival rates of fetuses and increase in fetal death rates were detected; thus, the substance was classified into Category 2."

In contrast, in other oral administration tests using rats that were conducted for 30 months (JMPR No. 8 (2000)), histopathological effects related to the administration on the liver were not observed, concluding that there is no evidence of carcinogenicity associated with this substance. Yet, in other 2-year oral administration tests using rats (JMPR No. 21 (1980)), the conclusion was drawn that this substance is not involved in tumorigenesis of the organs. Furthermore, in 23-month oral administration tests using mice (JMPR No. 8 (2000)), although increased incidences of adenoma were detected, the conclusion was drawn that there was no statistically significant trend for carcinomas. Similarly, no signs of carcinogenicity were detected in other tests including 18-month oral administration (through drinking water) tests using mice (JMPR No. 21 (1980)), and 2-year oral administration tests using mice (HSDB (2006)). Based on these results, the substance was classified into \"Not classified\"."
