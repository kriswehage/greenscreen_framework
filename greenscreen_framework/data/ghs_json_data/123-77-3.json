Additionally, multiple incidents showing a relationship between occupational exposure to this substance and asthma or respiratory symptoms were reported (IUCLID (2000)). Based on the above data and information, it was concluded that the key toxic effect of this substance in humans is asthmagenicity (CICADs 16 (1999)).
