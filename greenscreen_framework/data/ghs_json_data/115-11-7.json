It is described that in a 28 day gavage administration test using rats, a decrease in total white blood cell count (44%: females; 11%: males) (predominantly in leucocytes and monocytes) at the dose of 150 mg/kg/day\u2014equivalent to the guidance value of Category 2\u2014showed statistical significance compared with those of the control group, but conclude to be within the historical data. Based on the above results, neither inhalation tests nor oral tests showed significant influences within the guidance values, and the substance should be classified into \"Not classified\" (inhalation, oral). However, since no information with the dermal route is available, the substance was classified into \"Classification not possible\". "

In addition, there were no increased incidences of proliferative lesions of the thyroid gland in exposed female rats compared to the chamber controls (SIDS (accessed in August 2008)). Furthermore, since tumor formation was not seen in mice, the carcinogenicity of this substance was considered to be weak (SIDS (accessed in August 2008)).
