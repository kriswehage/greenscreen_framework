Additionally, in a test in which rats were fed a diet containing the substance at 5% concentration, the papillomatous growths in the forestomach was reported (JECFA (1997)). However, both tests used only a single dose, and the transdermal administration test had a problem in that administration doses were inappropriately changed during the test.
