In 90 to 110-day inhalation exposure tests (23 hours/day) using rats, NOAEL was 0.02 mg/L (equivalent to Category 2 guidance values) and LOAEL was not obtained. In 85 to 110 day inhalation exposure tests (23 hours/day) using guinea pigs, NOAEL was 0.159 mg/L, which is above Category 2 guidance values, and fatty vacuolization in the liver was detected at 0.2 mg/L (given that the saturated vapour pressure concentration is 0.04 mg/L, the study was presumably carried out in a mist state) (SIDS (accessed in November 2008)). In 90 to 110-day inhalation exposure tests (23 hours/day) using dogs, NOAEL was 0.02 mg/L and chronic pulmonary inflammation was detected at 0.2 mg/L. In 90 to 110-day inhalation exposure tests (23 hours/day) using monkeys, NOAEL was 0.02 mg/L and chronic pleuritis was found at 0.2 mg/L (SIDS (accessed in November 2008)). Since all NOAELs obtained in different animal tests are above Category 2 guidance values, the substance presumably has no effects at doses that are within the range of guidance values. These results indicate that the substance falls under the \"Not classified\" category (inhalation); however, since its effects through other administration routes are unclear, the substance was classified into the \"Classification not possible\" category. As additional background information, in a 28-day oral exposure test using rats that received 60, 200, or 700 mg/kg (Toxicity Testing Reports of Environmental Chemicals (Chemicals Investigation Promoting Council), accessed in November 2008), increased hyaline droplets and acidophilic bodies in the proximal renal tubular epithelium were found in male rats at 200 mg/kg (the 90-day conversion value falls under Category 2 guidance values). However, these changes were considered to be specific to male rats, so we did not evaluate this study."
