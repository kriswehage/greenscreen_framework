In a 26-week inhalation test with mice (dose levels: 0.195 - 19.5 mg/L), increased incidences of hindlimb paralysis, spinal cord degeneration, degeneration of the olfactory epithelium, epithelial hyperplasia of the forestomach, and macrocytic anemia were observed. Grip strength of the hindlimb in the 220 ppm (0.613 mg/L) and higher concentration exposure groups was significantly lower than that in the control group (SIDS (2005)). After 26 week of recovery, the incidence of degeneration of the spinal cord was significantly increased in all treatment groups (SIDS (2005)). Since degeneration of the spinal cord is considered to be a cause of hindlimb paralysis and this effect occurred at dose levels within the guidance value range for Category 1, the substance was classified into Category 1 (nervous system).
