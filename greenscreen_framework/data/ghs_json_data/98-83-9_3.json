There is a report of \"long-term inhalation exposure can induce central nervous system depression\" in humans (Hazard Data Book for Chemical Substance (CERI) (2001)). However, this information is reported in a document in List 3, therefore the data was not used as the basis of classification.",

            "rationale": "Following 8-hour inhalation (vapour) exposure, lid closure, incoordination and anesthesia were observed in rats at 12.3 mg/L (4-hour equivalent: 17.4 mg/L) (Initial Risk Assessment Report (NITE, CERI, NEDO) (2008)). Decreased locomotor activity and staggering gait were observed in the high-dose group of rats following oral exposure to the substance (Initial Risk Assessment Report (NITE, CERI, NEDO) (2008)). In rabbits, decrease in locomotor activity and convulsion were observed following dermal exposure (Initial Risk Assessment Report (NITE, CERI, NEDO) (2008)). In humans, acute exposure to styrene is suggested to cause central nervous system depression, including incoordination, muscle weakness, drunkenness and loss of consciousness (HSDB (2005)). Since the effects on nervous system were clearly indicated, and the findings of rats in the inhalation test reported above were noted at dose level within the guidance value range for Category 2, the substance was classified into Category 2 (nervous system). The substance is irritating to the upper respiratory tract as well as eyes and skin (Hazard Data Book for Chemical Substance (CERI) (2001), HSDB (2005)). In a human test, volunteers complained about severe irritation of the mucous membrane of the eyes and nose (DFGOT vol. 15 (2001)). Based on the data, the substance was classified into Category 3 (respiratory tract irritation).",
