            "rationale": "It was reported that in survivors of acute intoxications with the substance, neurological lesions regress very slowly and frequently, the intoxication is followed by a phase with psychic disorders such as confusion, hallucinations, delusions and paranoia which can persist for years (DFGOT vol. 7 (1979)). Based on this information, the substance was classified into Category 1 (nervous system). In an oral test in mice, a decrease in alertness, decreased locomotor activity, prone position, staggering gait, drowsiness, decreased responsiveness, dorsal position, gait difficulty and bradypnea were observed (A pesticide abstract and evaluation report (Food and Agricultural Materials Inspection Center) (2008)). In an inhalation test in rats, increase in repetitive movement of mouth and jaw, shallow respiration, sitting position with dropped head, ptosis, salivation, gasping, hunchback position, gait disturbance, decreases in ambulatory movement and locomotor activity were observed (Test Data for Supporting Registration of Pesticides (2004)). These signs suggest an effect on the nervous system.",
