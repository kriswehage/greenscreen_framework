Based on these each viscosity data and on the fact that the densities of these 3 isomers are smaller than 0.9, it is judged that the dynamic viscosity of trimethyl benzene at 40 degrees C (the mixture of three isomers) is fully less than 20.5mm 2/s.

Furthermore, there is the description that [bronchitis or chemical pneumonia will be caused if the liquid enters into the lungs](SITTIG (4th, 2002)), and we classified it as Category 1 based on these descriptions."
