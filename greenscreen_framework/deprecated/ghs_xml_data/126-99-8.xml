    <rationale>There is the report that there is no disorder of reproductive potential of parent, embryotoxicity, and teratogenicity (ACGIH (2001), PATTY (5th, 2001), IARC 19 (1999)). But in many other reports, there is the description of inhibition of spermatogenesis of male rat (ACGIH (2001)), of the examples of mating impossibility and sterility of male rat and male mouse (ACGIH (2001)), and  embryotoxicity as embryonic lethallity etc.  and malformation as hydrocephalus and meningoencephalocele etc. (ACGIH (2001), SIDS (2003), IARC 19 (1999)). There is the description that it occure dysorders of spermatogenesis and it is observed sperm morphological defect on humans, and there is a lot of natural abortion among the wives of chloroprene laborers (IARC 19 (1979)).

Due to the descriptions that it causes liver damage in dosage range of the guidance value of Category 1 in rat (ACGIH (2001)), and that it cases damage to liver, lungs, and the kidney in human (IARC 19 (1979)), it was classified into Category 1(liver, lungs, kidney). Due to the descriptions that it affects the airway in dosage range of the guidance value of Cagegory 1 in rat (PATTY (5th, 2001)), and that it develops dyspnea by stimulates mucosa (IARC 19 (1979)), it was classified into Category 3 (airway stimulativeness). In addition, since there is no description of specific conditions about central nervous systems or the degree of inhibition and no description of related-anesthetic actions, it was classified into Category 1 (central nervous system). Category 1 (lung) and Category 3 (respiratory irritant) were classified into Category 1 (respiratory systems).</rationale>

Since there was the statement of a dental corrosion, gingivitis, a periodontal membrane flame, and a decreased immunoreaction in humans (IARC 19 (1979)) , it was classified in Category 1 (a tooth, periodontal tissue, immunity system). Since there are the statement that plasma cholinesterase reduction in activity was seen in humans (IARC 19 (1979)) , and the statement that the necrobiosis in liver was seen in the amount of exposure of the guidance value range of Category 1in the rat and a hamster and the organization obstacle of lungs in the rat (PATTY (5th, 2001)),  it was classified in Category 1 (lungs,liver). It was classified in Category 1 (stomach) and Category 2 (blood, olfactus organ) based on the statement that the abnormalities in blood coagulation, the denaturation and fault formation of a sense-of-smell epithelium, and fault formation of the front gastric epithelium were seen in a rat in the amount of exposure of the guidance value range of Category 2(PATTY (5th, 2001))  , and the  statement   that gastrointestinal disorders was seen in humans (IARC 19 (1979)). Based on the statement of the inflammation of a nasal cavity in the amount of exposure of the guidance value range of Category 2 in a rat (PATTY (5th, 2001)), it was classified in Category 2 (respiratory tracts).</rationale>
