However, hydrazine monohydrate is easily formed when hydrazine (ID: 0056, CAS No.302-01-2) comes in contact with water. Hence, an aqueous solution of hydrazine often used in animal studies is also considered to be "hydrazine (mono)hydrate." Therefore, in evaluating hydrazine monohydrate, it is advised to refer to "hydrazine" (ID 0056, CAS No.302-01-2) as well.
