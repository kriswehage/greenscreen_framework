    <rationale>Respirator: No data
Skin: There is no test data on skin sensitizing of sulfuric acids. Although sulfuric acid has been industrially used for several decades, there is no case report of skin sensitization, while skin injuries by skin irritation is well known. Although an extensive amount of sulfate ion exists internally (the sulfate ion in serum being 33 mmol/L and 50 times that in cells),  allergic reactions do not occur. In metal study of allergic aspermatogenic sulfate, even if  allergy positive with metal may occur, sulfuric ion is presumed to result in allegic negative as is suggested by the negative results in sulffate of zinc. Based on the description  that a conclusion is drawn from the results mentioned above that sulfate does not cause allergy to humans(SIDS, 1998).Therefore it was put  outside of the Category.</rationale>

However, sulfuric acids itself was classified into the category 4 according to DFGOT (vol.15, 2001).
