    <rationale>There is no report on humans. 
In an oral administration test to pregnant rats, delayed fetal development and delayed ossification of sternal bones and skuls were observed (ACGIH (2002)). 
Moreover, although effects on female reproductive ability were not observed but epithelium spotty necrosis of tubulus seminiferus contortus and spermatogenic disorder were observede in microscopy of male testis in the test in which male rats exposed orally or by inhalation were made to mate with non-exposed female rats (ACGIH (2002)). 
Reduction of coupling and the rate of delivery, increase in the number of stillbirth, and reduction in the number of newborn were observed in mating with male rats administered in drinking water and female rats without treatment(HSDB (2003)). 
Reduction of the pregnancy rate and the number of delivery of mother animals and decrease of survived offsprings count (F1b) were observed in the test which female rats were copulated with male rats given drinking water administration and were continuously exposed during the pregnancy period and for 10 days after lactation before mating with another male without treatment(HSDB (2003)). 
In the test which female rats that had mated with male rats administrated in drinking water again mated with new males administrated in drinking water after their delivery, reduction of mating rate, the rate of pregnancy and infant animals' weight of the 21st day(F1b) was observed(HSDB (2003)). 
It was classified into Category 2 based on the above statement.
